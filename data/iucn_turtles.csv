507698,12695,Malaclemys terrapin,Vulnerable,A4acde,2019,2018-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>                 <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;is assessed as Vulnerable due to observed threats documented in the past and projected into the future with ≥35% population declines of monitored populations resulting from overexploitation, accidental mortality as bycatch in commercial Blue Crab fisheries, coastal habitat loss due to development, principally the loss of limited nesting habitat, in addition to extensive estuarine saltmarsh loss, and ongoing subsidized nest predation by mesopredators (threats reviewed in Roosenburg 2004; Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018; Chambers and Maerz 2018; Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018). Overall, it is our assessment that <em>M. terrapin</em> has sustained range-wide population declines over the last 30 years (two generations) of 25-30% and that the rate of decline is predicted to continue at the same rate for another 15 years (one generation), or about a 10-15% further decline, for a total decline over three generations (45 years) of 35-45%. The species therefore meets the criteria for Vulnerable designation under criteria A4acde. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was last assessed in 1996, when it was evaluated as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>Documenting population declines for a long-lived species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is challenging and requires intensive, long-term sampling (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 2001). Female terrapins become sexually mature at 4-13 years and longevity may exceed 50 years. Using an average estimated generation time of 15 years, it is reasonable to examine trends in the terrapin population for the past 30 years (two generations) and project 15 years (one generation) into the future. Subpopulations for which long-term data are available show significant declines, upwards to 75% decrease in population size over 20 years in the two populations with long term data in South Carolina (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007), Maryland (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and 55% decline in a New York population over 20 years (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data). Other populations have high mortality rates due to anthropogenic causes (Wood and Herlands 1997; Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018) and, in some cases, a change in population structure has been observed (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 1997; Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is not possible to determine range-wide population declines over specific time periods other than to rely on anecdotal evidence suggesting that terrapins are now rarely encountered in areas where they were once relatively common (Kennedy 2018a,b).</p><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><p></p></span>","<p>                      </p><p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> is found in brackish coastal waters (salinity range = 0 to <a style=""mso-comment-reference: WMR_1;mso-comment-date:20161231T0810"">35</a>). Typical habitats include coastal regions, estuaries, lagoons, tidal creeks, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. In coastal estuaries supporting large watersheds, terrapins can occur far inland up to the terminal end of the salt wedge (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Hudson River, and Pamlico Sound). Although <em>M. terrapin</em> is found in brackish water, periodic access to freshwater is necessary for long-term health, and populations in high salinity habitats actively seek and drink freshwater which is essential for neonate survival and growth (Dunson 1985; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009) and may be a contributing factor to the semi-terrestrial behavior of neonates to 3-year-olds.&#160;Hatchlings are exceptionally desiccation tolerant (Figueras <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The diet of <em>M. terrapin</em> consists largely of invertebrates, crustaceans, and mollusks (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2018) and a variety of plant materials and algae (Tulipani 2015; Erazmus <em>et al</em>. 2018). In some populations terrapins are predators of the Salt Marsh Periwinkle (<em>Littoraria irrorata</em>), a snail that grazes on epiphytes that grow on Salt Marsh Cord Grass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>). Silliman and Bertness (2002) demonstrated through a series of experiments that when periwinkle predators were removed, periwinkles damage and kill cord grass, leaving a barren mudflat and increasing marsh erosion rates. Although terrapins were not removed or tested in this experiment, as a periwinkle predator they are frequently identified as a potential saltmarsh keystone species. This extrapolation suggests that healthy terrapin populations play a role in maintaining primary production in salt marsh ecosystems and stabilizing shoreline vegetation, thus reducing local erosion.<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> exhibits considerable variation in size, sexual size dimorphism, and reproductive output throughout its range. In general, along the Atlantic sea board there is a gradient of increasing body size, greater sexual dimorphism, later ages of maturity, and higher reproductive output with increasing latitude (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gulf Coast populations do not conform to this latitudinal variation and are larger than their counterparts on the Atlantic Coast at the same latitude. Most comprehensive life history data come from long-term studies of populations in South Carolina, Maryland, and New York, with limited data from other parts of the range focused mostly on reproductive output and females. Nonetheless, the differences in morphological and life history traits contribute to different environmental stressors and management strategies relevant to terrapin populations throughout the range. Careful modeling is needed to compare reproductive traits among populations to assess how total annual reproductive output per individual varies along the latitudinal gradient.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins under natural conditions exhibit high adult survivorship, low reproductive rates, and high egg/juvenile mortality characteristic of most temperate turtles (Mitro 2003). As a consequence of this suite of life history traits, increases in adult mortality result in declining populations (Congdon <em>et al</em>. 1993, 1994). Marked variation in life history traits can be attributed to a broad latitudinal distribution (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Females from northern populations mature later and at a relatively larger size than those from southern populations. Clutch size and body size appear to be somewhat correlated over the range; females from New York average 12.8 eggs per clutch (Burke <em>et al</em>. 2018), Maryland females may produce as many as 26 eggs per clutch (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and smaller females from more southern populations produce only 4–6 eggs per clutch (Seigel 1984). Average annual reproductive output depends on the number of clutches produced per season. In Chesapeake Bay populations, the average female may produce 1–3 clutches of about 13 eggs in a single nesting season (13–40 eggs/year) and detailed nesting data suggest that terrapins rarely forgo nesting annually, but the number of clutches per year may vary (Roosenburg and Dunham 1997). For detailed reviews of reproductive data, see Roosenburg (1994), Butler <em>et al</em>. (2006a, 2006b), Brennessel (2006), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Lovich <em>et al</em>. (2018).<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> demonstrates marked sexual dimorphism, most likely as a fecundity advantage (Carr 1952), with females being considerably larger, with maximum reported population mean female carapace length of 20.1 cm and male carapace length of 13.3 cm (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Female terrapins can reach weights over 2.5 kg in northern populations, but males rarely exceed 0.5 kg throughout the range (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The maximum recorded size for an adult female, 32 cm carapace length, is much greater than that of males, 16 cm, from the same population, and the discrepancy between male and female size increases with latitude (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Female terrapins mature later and at a larger size than males. The resulting difference in body size is more pronounced in more northern populations. Size differences result in differences in jaw morphology and bite forces that likely contribute to resource partitioning (diet, habitat) between the sexes (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1999; Herrel <em>et al</em>. 2018). Throughout their geographic range, population means for hatchlings range from 25–38 mm in carapace length and 6.3–8.8 g in mass (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Maturity is reached at 4–13 years of age in females, and 2–7 years in males, depending on location (see summary in Brennessel 2006). Longevity may be greater than 40 years for some individuals; marked adult females have been recaptured 30 years after their initial capture as adults (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation time has not been reported in the published literature; available information indicates that it ranges from 13 to 20 years and also increases with increasing latitude (Mitro 2003; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation times in more southern populations are shorter, as maturity at lower latitudes is attained several years earlier (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Nesting requirements vary among subpopulations (Roosenburg 1994, Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> embryos have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), with females produced at higher incubation temperatures, generating&#160;important differences between populations (Jeyasuria <em>et al</em>. 1994; Burke and Calichio 2014). The challenges of climate change, combined with sea level rise and nesting habitat loss (Michener <em>et al</em>. 1997, Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017) could potentially affect sex ratios in populations. The conservation challenges associated with climate change and TSD as it affects sex ratios generates new concerns for the effective management of terrapin populations throughout their range, particularly when integrated with the nesting habitat loss due to development (Seigel and Gibbons 1995).<br/><br/>Terrapin hatchlings in northern parts of the range also facultatively overwinter in the nest, suggesting that the nesting environment is critical habitat throughout the entire year (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2018; Graham 2009; Kitson 2016). Post-emergence neonate habitat is poorly known, but after emergence, some hatchlings move to shallow, self-excavated hibernacula in upland areas (Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004, Duncan and Burke 2016) before moving into intertidal marshes where they may remain semi-terrestrial well into their second growing season (Muldoon and Burke 2012). Adult terrapins hibernate communally in depressions in the mud at the bottom of tidal creeks and embayments protected from prevailing weather (Haramis <em>et al</em>. 2011), in undercut banks within the tidal zone, or burrow into creek banks (Yearicks <em>et al</em>. 1981). Southern subspecies (e.g., <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>) may be active throughout the winter.</p><br/><p></p>","<p>                      </p><p>                     </p><p>Four main factors pose the most significant threats to <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> populations: 1) mortality of juveniles and adults in crab pots and mostly nesting females on roads, 2) loss of nesting and juvenile habitat to development and sea level rise, 3) the effect of subsidized predators at nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Siegel and Gibbons 1995; Feinberg and Burke 2003; Woodland et al. 2017), and 4) loss of estuarine saltmarsh and mangrove habitats throughout their range (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008; Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In states with a commercial Blue Crab (<em>Callinectes sapidus</em>) fishery, which includes almost the terrapin’s entire range, incidental drowning in crab pots is considered to be the major threat to <em>M. terrapin</em> (Butler <em>et al</em>. 2006; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Terrapins, attracted to the bait, enter through an underwater opening, become trapped, and drown within a few hours (Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Small males and juveniles are caught more frequently than adult females due to the limitations on the size of the trap entrance. Wolak <em>et al</em>. (2010) suggested that high mortality in crab traps has led to selection on body size traits in a Chesapeake Bay population. Most studied populations where terrapins occurred with crab pots have skewed sex ratio biased toward females that have lower catch rates because of their larger size (Chambers and Maerz 2018).&#160;Crab pots remain the most prominent threat to terrapin populations and their ubiquitous use throughout the terrapin’s range and habitat hamper other conservation restoration efforts because the mortality caused by crab pots is so high.<br/><br/>Adult female terrapins are frequently struck and killed by motor vehicles while attempting to cross roads and motorways in search of nesting sites (Wood and Herlands 1997; Szerlag and McRobert 2006; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011; Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Hatchling terrapins migrate to water after emerging from the nest and can get trapped in vehicular tire tracks left in the sand on nesting beaches. If the hatchlings are unable to escape, they may die of dehydration or be crushed by the next vehicle. Large female terrapins often bear scars from the propellers of motor boats; in the Chesapeake Bay region and in Jamaica Bay, New York, boat impacts are a significant source of mortality for this age class in areas with moderate to high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Although most states now have legislation that regulates the collection of <em>M. terrapin</em> (Hackney 2010; Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy 2018a), this species is still taken commercially in parts of Louisiana. Commercial interest in terrapins remains high, primarily for trade and consumption in Asia or to Asian communities in North America. Hatchlings sell in pet markets of Hong Kong for $50-500 each depending on colouration (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.). In 2006, the last year in which terrapins were legally harvested in Maryland, watermen reported a catch of 10,500 pounds of terrapins. Additionally, harvest of terrapins for turtle farms in the US and Asia is taxing wild populations and contributing to potential illegal harvest in states where they are currently protected. One such event resulted in the offtake of more than 3,000 females from a single population in New Jersey. Serendipitously, this event resulted in the closure of the commercial terrapin harvest in New Jersey.<br/><br/>One of the terrapin subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>, is considered endemic and endangered in its restricted range in southern Florida. Unless examined by expert terrapin biologists familiar with all the subspecies, <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em> could easily be traded unnoticed because of its similarity to the other subspecies. Similar to endangered map turtles, genus <em>Graptemys</em>, some of which also can only be recognized by experts, the trade of endangered terrapin subspecies is facilitated by the trade of the species in general. Furthermore, several states throughout the range have provided protected status to terrapins or restricted trade and harvest. These terrapins cannot be distinguished from terrapins that were collected from areas where they were legally harvested or from farm-produced individuals.<br/><br/>Habitat destruction poses a serious and ongoing threat to the species. The Diamondback Terrapin’s range is coincident with areas of dense human population (Ner and Burke 2008), and &gt;50% of original estuarine saltmarsh habitat in terrapin range has been lost over the last century (Kennish 2001). Coastal development, particularly salt marsh draining and shoreline armoring for residential or agricultural purposes, increased use of coastal waterways for commercial and recreational purposes, and loss of sand dunes (important nesting habitat) contribute to habitat loss and degradation which negatively affects terrapins (Isdell <em>et al</em>. 2015). Coastal development is particularly problematic because it frequently destroys nesting beaches (Roosenburg 1991; Roosenburg and Place 1995). Three consequences of development for terrapins are: 1) higher concentration of nesting habitat in remaining areas resulting in greater predation rates of nests, 2) alteration of incubation conditions potentially affecting survivorship and gender because of temperature-dependent sex determination, and 3) increased predation on adult females. Additionally, sea level rise due to climate change may have a severe impact on diamondback terrapin habitat including loss of nesting habitat, but more seriously the elimination of critical juvenile salt marsh habitat. Recent GIS modeling based on predicted sea level rise suggests substantial habitat loss during the next 50-100 years in Chesapeake Bay (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Human-subsidized predators (i.e., native or introduced animals whose populations prosper as a result of association with humans and human-altered habitats) are another threat to turtle populations (Boarman 1997). Studies across the range have identified (locally introduced) Raccoons (<em>Procyon lotor</em>), Skunks (<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>), Coyotes (<em>Canis latrans</em>), feral Hogs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>), and non-native Norway Rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>) as major predators on the adults, juveniles, and eggs of <em>M. terrapin</em>, accounting for a nest predation rate of 92%, and emerging hatchling predation rate of up to 20% (Feinberg and Burke 2003; Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004; Muldoon and Burke 2012; Buzuleciu <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Finally, the impacts of various pollutants in heavily urbanized estuarine environments jeopardize terrapin populations. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals and various insecticides and herbicides all potentially affect terrapins (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018). Many of these compounds have been discovered in terrapins and have been demonstrated to have deleterious effects on development, growth, and survival (Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009; Holliday and Holliday 2011; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Microplastics, which are both pollutants themselves and synergists with other pollutants, were found in the feces of eight of eight terrapins tested in Jamaica Bay, New York (R.L. Burke, unpubl. data).</p><p></p>","<p>In the early 1900s, populations of <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> were in danger of extinction due to intense commercial harvest for human consumption (Hay 1917). Although pre-harvest population data are lacking, many populations had recovered to some extent by the late 20th century and <em>M. terrapin</em> was listed as Lower Risk/Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List in 1996 (Kennedy 2018b). However, data from long-term studies (Avissar 2006; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Roosenburg 2004; Wood and Herlands 1997) suggest that many terrapin populations are again in decline. Effects that contribute to observed declines in well-studied subpopulations (ongoing habitat loss/degradation, crab pot mortality, subsidized nest predation, and road mortality) are ubiquitous and likely to have a similar effect throughout the terrapin’s range (Seigel and Gibbons 1995). Low recruitment due to high nest predation, juvenile and adult male mortality in crab pots and high adult female mortality from vehicle collisions and crab pots in southern populations are cause for alarm because population models suggest a stable population requires both modest recruitment and, most importantly, high adult survival (Roosenburg 2004; Mitro 2003).<br/><br/>In Kiawah, South Carolina, population estimates from a mark-recapture study of <em>M. terrapin</em><span class=""datalabel1""> suggest a decline of 75% over the last two decades (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). High male and juvenile mortality rates in this population, likely due to incidental drowning in crab pots, result in an increase in the proportion of large females in the population (Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). Similarly, crab pots have been suggested to cause female biased sex ratios (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and potentially driving the evolution of male body size (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010) in Chesapeake Bay. Similar levels of decline have been observed in the adult female population during a 20 year population study in the Patuxent River of Chesapeake Bay. Factors contributing to the decline in the Patuxent population include commercial harvest, bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries, an oil spill, and nesting habitat loss (W.M. Roosenburg, <span class=""datalabel1"">unpubl<span class=""datalabel1"">.<span class=""datalabel1""> data<span class=""datalabel1"">).<br/><br/>Commercial and recreational use of crab pots continues to be the major contributing factor to the population declines from New Jersey to Texas (Bishop 1983; Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Seigel and Gibbons 1994; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Populations in Chesapeake Bay have female biased sex ratios due to the impact of crab pots (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) in addition to compensatory growth and changed size structure as a consequence of continued crab pot mortality (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent work has suggested that even a single crab pot in a tidal creek or local area can drive population declines (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In estuaries near Tuckerton,&#160;New Jersey, road mortality contributed to a significant decline in the number of adult females over 13 years (Avissar 2006). This demographic shift was not attributed to crab pot mortality because the site is closed to crabbing; however, a decline in large females is consistent with the observation that road mortality of nesting females had increased (Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006). A long-term study on the Cape May Peninsula of southernmost New Jersey documented 4,020 road kills during a 7-year period (Wood and Herlands 1997). As of 2011, the total number of roadkills at this study site has surpassed 10,000 adult females (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data). The terrapin population decline during this time is unknown, but is likely substantial because the area also has a significant commercial and recreational crab fishery (Wood 1997). Similarly in Georgia, small tidal creeks impacted by commercial crabbing and nearby roads had reduced terrapin populations relative to creeks more isolated from these threats (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>New York’s largest terrapin populations inhabit the heavily-urbanized Jamaica Bay. Researchers observed over 2,000 nests on one island in this study area in 1998 (Feinberg and Burke 2003). Recruitment is low because annual nest predation rates, primarily by raccoons, vary from 92-100%. The number of nests laid per year declined 43% from 1999-2011 (Feinberg and Burke 2003; R.L. Burke, unpubl. data) and the nesting terrapin population has experienced a 55% decline from 1998 to 2017 (R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Little is known about terrapin populations along the Gulf Coast. Historical accounts suggest large populations once existed in this part of the range, but overexploitation has reduced populations which are slow to recover in the face of heavy crabbing pressure (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Dauphine Island, Alabama, formerly supported a significant terrapin fishery which currently remains as a relic population (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recent studies in Louisiana have discovered subpopulations in the Rockefeller National Wildlife Refuge and its adjoining bayous and in Barataria Bay, but detailed population and life history data are lacking from this area (Selman <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pearson and Wiebe 2018). Small populations are also known from Galveston Bay, Texas, but the combination of development and pollution has reduced the available habitat to a few small islands within the bay (V. Guillory, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bermuda’s terrapin population is estimated at about 100 individuals and recruitment is low, caused by low nest success (Outerbridge 2014). The reasons for developmental failure are not known, but could be due to insecticides and herbicides used around the only wetland where terrapins are found (M.E. Outerbridge, pers. comm.).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin </em>inhabits the estuarine coastal waters of the United States along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to Corpus Christi, Texas (Iverson 1992; TTWG 2017). A breeding subpopulation also is found in the Bermuda Islands (Davenport et al. 2005), which was considered native by Parham <em>et al</em>. (2008) and genetically attributed to subspecies <em>M. t. centrata</em>. The human role in the origin of the Bermuda subpopulation remains under consideration (Lovich and Hart 2018), but it currently is an established and protected population (Outerbridge 2014).<br/><br/>Subspecific distributional information for the morphologically-defined historically recognized subspecies is as follows (noting, however, that molecular phylogeography does not agree with this pattern, but that a revised taxonomy has not yet been formulated; see Taxonomy section):<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin terrapin</em>: from Cape Cod, Massachusetts southward to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin centrata</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin centrata</em>: from the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina southward to northern peninsular Florida, where it meets and intergrades with <em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>; also on Bermuda.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin tequesta</em>: Atlantic east coast of peninsular Florida to Biscayne Bay, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>.</p>  <p><em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em>: Florida Keys westward to the Marquesas Keys.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin macrospilota</em>: Gulf coast of peninsular Florida, intergrading with <em>M. terrapin pileata</em> in the panhandle and with <em>M. terrapin rhizophorarum</em> in Florida Bay.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin pileata</em>: from the Florida panhandle, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin macrospilota, </em>to<em> </em>Louisiana, where it intergrades with <em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>.<br/><br/><em>M. terrapin littoralis</em>: western Louisiana and the coast of Texas, at least as far south as Corpus Christi Bay.<br/><br/>Anecdotal reports that this species is found in Mexican waters (e.g., Carr 1952) have been disputed (Smith and Smith 1979); there is no credible information indicating occurrence in Mexico (Iverson 1992; Mexican Red List Workshop participants, Sept. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Range Size:</strong>&#160;The presence of a coastal species like <em>M. terrapin</em> is difficult to determine because of their cryptic nature and the inaccessibility of much of their habitat. Its distribution is discontinuous along the ~5,000 km of coastline between Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Corpus Christi, Texas. However, it is unknown if the discontinuity can be attributed to natural biological boundaries or to barriers created by extensive urbanization and industrial development in portions of its coastal habitat. Terrapins inhabit salt marshes that form on the bay side of barrier islands, and the extent to which they move inland via estuaries varies considerably, but seems to be bounded by waters that are brackish for most of the year.&#160; Nonetheless, terrapin habitat, salt marsh juvenile habitat, and nesting areas, have all diminished greatly because of salt marsh loss and the development of coastal and estuarine waterfront (Kennish 2001; Ner and Burke 2008). No range-wide population estimate is available, but data are consistent in that subpopulations are local, sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation, and many individually studied subpopulations are small, while others are more robust (summarized in Roosenburg and Kennedy 2018).</p>","<p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em>&#160;was utilized for food prior to European settlement in North America; however, as human populations increased throughout the terrapin’s range and terrapin consumption became fashionable, the exploitation reached unsustainable levels. By the late 19th century native populations were in dramatic decline, warranting the first federal attempts to farm terrapins (Kennedy 2018a). Captive propagation for commercial purposes was initiated in the early 20th century because of range-wide population declines and danger of extinction, indicating that fisheries of wild populations were not sustainable (Hay 1917). Extensive data are available for artificial propagation of terrapins for commercial purposes (Hay 1917; Coker 1920; Hildebrand and Hatsel 1926; Hildebrand 1932) but the general consensus of these studies was that it is not economically feasible to farm terrapins as a food source because of slow growth rates. The demand for terrapin meat eventually decreased and the depleted populations began to slowly recover after 1930 (Carr 1952). In the early 2000s increases in the commercial capture and trade of terrapins were identified (USDA 2011). Most of the captured turtles were shipped to Asian communities in major metropolitan areas in the US and also exported to Asia. This increase in demand alarmed turtle biologists and prompted many states to increase regulations, protection, and monitoring of terrapin populations (Kennedy 2018a). The primary concern with the resurgence of the commercial terrapin fishery is that, combined with habitat degradation, recovery will be slower, if not impossible. Export data for terrapins in 1999-2010 indicate an increase in the number of individuals and shipments, primarily as exports to Asia (USDA 2011). Concern about the increases in terrapin export has resulted in the closure of the remaining commercial wild harvest in all states except Louisiana. Maryland closed their commercial fishery, based primarily on the export to China and declining populations in Chesapeake Bay (Roosenburg <em>et al.</em> 2008). Following the closure of the Maryland fishery exports dropped by approximately 25% from their peak and most exports at this time are believed to originate from farms, although this has not been confirmed. Today, Louisiana remains the only state where terrapins can be harvested from the wild for commercial sale. Many states maintain a subsistence harvest of two per day for either consumption or pets.<br/><br/>Terrapins are currently bred in captivity (turtle farms) on a small scale in the United States and the hatchlings are sold commercially for the pet trade and to supply aquaculture rearing facilities in Asia that eventually supply the consumption trade and maintain reproductive colonies for the pet trade. Recent exports of high numbers of terrapin hatchlings originating from the single commercial turtle farm in Maryland revealed that successful terrapin farming requires a constant infusion of wild brood stock. The adults that produced most of the hatchlings sold were obtained from New Jersey in a manner that was disputably legal or illegal; New Jersey subsequently closed its commercial terrapin fishery (T. Leuteritz, pers. comm.).</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>Diamondback Terrapins are protected from commercial exploitation in most states where they occur, but as of early 2018 commercial harvests remain permitted under regulations in Louisiana (Kennedy, 2018a). Personal possession is permitted under certain conditions in most states (Nanjappa and Conrad 2011; Kennedy, 2018a) but restricted in most cases to no more than two individuals and permits required for possession as pets. <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> was included in CITES Appendix II in 2013, making its international trade subject to determinations and evaluation that traded volumes are not detrimental to the survival of wild populations.<br/><br/>Hackney (2010) used the standardized Natural Heritage Program to compare the conservation status of terrapins among range states. Of the 16 range states, one (Rhode Island) lists the species as S1, or critically imperiled. Four states list the species as S2, imperiled, while six states list it as S3, vulnerable. Four states consider the diamondback terrapin to be S4, apparently secure. South Carolina has not ranked terrapins according to this scale. State protective listing or harvest regulation in all range states is recommended. In Bermuda, diamondback terrapins have level 2 protection under the Protected Species Order 2012.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins reside in coastal habitats that are intensively used and modified by humans (Kennish 2001, Ner and Burke 2008, Gedan <em>et al</em>. 2009). Safeguarding areas of optimal habitat, particularly foraging, nesting and hibernation sites, from development and other modification is essential for the long-term survival of this species. Terrapins occur in a substantial number of protected areas and their movement is limited (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mortality in crab pots and habitat fragmentation are suggested to reduce gene flow while signatures of the past commercial trade and movement of terrapins are still detectable in some populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2017, Converse and Kuchta, 2018). Terrapins use a variety of estuarine habitats throughout their range and local populations effectively exploit their native habitat. Populations can grow and respond quickly when provided with predator-free nesting areas, high quality juvenile habitat, and protection of adults, in particular reproductive females (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.L. Burke, unpubl. data), suggesting that estuarine or marine preserves combined with nest predator control can provide an effective tool to restore terrapin populations in areas where numbers are reduced (Roosenburg 2018).<br/><br/>Bycatch reduction devices (BRD) can greatly reduce the number of terrapins that drown in crab traps (Wood 1997; Hoyle and Gibbons 2000; Roosenburg and Green 2000; Butler and Heinrich 2007). By installing BRDs in crab pots, most adult female terrapins are excluded, particular in mid-Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, and the Gulf coast regions where body sizes are larger. BRDs are also effective in southern Atlantic regions and Florida and perhaps more important because adult females never outgrow the vulnerability to crab pots without BRDs (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011). Several states now require BRDs; however, regulations vary considerably across the terrapin’s range (Hackney 2010), as does the intensity of enforcement of regulations. Broad adoption of BRDs will significantly assist the species' prospects (Guillory and Prejean 1998; Rook <em>et al</em>. 2010; Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;Perhaps the greatest concern for terrapins is entrapment in derelict or ghost crab pots that are not regularly checked. Several cases have been recorded where &gt;20 individuals have been recovered dead from crab pots that were abandoned, one with more than 100 individuals (Bishop 1983; Roosenburg 1991; Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>  <p>                     </p><p>Since 2003, research scientists and summer interns at The Wetlands Institute in New Jersey have deployed barrier fencing to reduce road mortality in their study area. Results to date suggest that barrier fencing can be an effective terrapin conservation tool (McLaughlin <em>et al</em>. 2012). Similarly, at JFK Airport in New York, personnel successfully use barrier fencing to keep terrapins off runways (Burke and Francoeur 2014). Combined with nesting habitat improvement adjacent to roadways, fencing can dramatically reduce roadway mortality and help direct terrapins to protected nesting sites (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b; Maerz <em>et al</em>. 2018). Finally, roadway warning signals activated at times of peak nesting in high use areas can dramatically reduce nesting female road mortality. Impacts by watercraft also present a problem for terrapins in areas with high boat traffic (Roosenburg 1991; Lester <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, terrapins appear not to respond to the noise of approaching vessels, increasing the risk of boat impact; thus suggesting that marine speed limits near areas of terrapin congregation (e.g., nesting beaches) would be the only effective mechanism to reduce boat strikes (Lester <em>et al</em>. 2014, 2018).<br/><br/>Nest protection and head-starting programs exist at a variety of locations, and are subject to active research on their effective contribution to population dynamics and establishment success (Herlands <em>et al</em>. 2004; Smeenk 2010; Petrov 2014; Roosenburg 2018). High nest predation remains a key conservation problem for terrapins and control of mammalian nest predators increases nest success (Munscher <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the complete absence of nest predators can contribute to population recovery (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Head-starting can supplement population growth and head-started individuals can establish within native populations. Furthermore, head-started females can become reproductive and some remain in the local population where they were released (Roosenburg 2018). However, the low level of gene flow among populations (Converse <em>et al</em>. 2015) suggests that source animals should only come from the same population they will supplement or from the nearest population for extirpated areas.<br/><br/>One example of effective terrapin conservation and restoration is the Paul S. Sarbanes Environmental Restoration Project at Poplar Island, Chesapeake Bay, Maryland (Roosenburg et al. 2014, Roosenburg 2018). Poplar Island’s restoration has established predator-free nesting habitat and extensive salt marsh habitat for juveniles. There also is an active head-starting program on Poplar Island. The terrapin population on Poplar Island is growing rapidly due primarily to the high nest survival (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014) and high quality juvenile habitat that ensures high post-hatching juvenile survivorship (Roosenburg 2018). Although head-starting does contribute to population growth, its impacts are secondary to that of the habitat creation and protection (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The Poplar Island example illustrates the basic requirements for population recovery which suggests that estuarine reserves or sanctuaries that include both nesting and juvenile habitat, combined with nest predator control, offer an excellent strategy for terrapin population recovery.<br/><br/>Further research on terrapin conservation is needed, particularly towards understanding individual and seasonal movement patterns, habitat use at different life stages, and refinement of the taxonomy. Although some populations and areas are well studied, other parts of the range have less data, particularly the Gulf Coast and the populations within Pamlico Sound and the estuarine waters of North Carolina, and southern New England. Most states have some form of ongoing terrapin research, but the expansive range and the need for boats to access key habitats limits both surveys and detailed population studies. Recent work also has suggested that climate change will dramatically affect habitat availability for terrapins, particularly the juvenile dependence on saltmarsh habitat, which is predicted to decline dramatically due to sea level rise (Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017). Further study of the effects of sea level rise is needed to evaluate how habitat and resources will be affected.<br/><br/>Although these conservation targets have been known for years, declines in terrapin populations have not been fully addressed for a variety of issues. Conservation measures, such as establishing requirements for bycatch reduction devices in crab pots, have often been effectively resisted by commercial fishermen through political lobbying efforts. Furthermore, even with regulations in place, lack of compliance and enforcement results in ineffective use rates (Radzio <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, conflicts between the preservation of nesting habitat shoreline and the development and protection of high-value coastal real estate seem to preempt terrapin conservation measures. Despite the slow pace of terrapin conservation, some progress has been made to reduce road mortality in some areas (Crawford <em>et al</em>. 2013a,b) and population recovery and growth have been observed in at least one population (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additionally, the technology to reduce terrapin capture in crab pots has made substantial progress (Roosenburg 2004, Chambers and Maerz 2018) as range-wide fine-tuning of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) continues (Schwenter and Arndt, unpubl. data).</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
508210,12696,Malacochersus tornieri,Critically Endangered,A4abcd,2019,2018-10-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Malacochersus tornieri</em>&#160;is severely threatened by overexploitation for the international live exotic animal trade, with large numbers of animals recorded in the trade. Previously known subpopulations of <em>M. tornieri</em> have been depleted and locally extirpated by ongoing offtake to supply both the legal and illegal international animal trade. Habitat degradation from rock destruction that reduces available micro-habitats is also an important threat, especially as related to illegal tortoise collection, but also for construction purposes and slab and ballast extraction, and kiln building for charcoal production. General habitat destruction, loss, and modification from vegetation degradation through slash-and-burn cultivation, wildfires, and charcoal burning are also detrimental to the species because they negatively affect the ability to feed, and increase exposure to predation, thermal stress, and exploitation. The species is slow to mature and has very low fecundity, with only one or occasionally two eggs laid annually and is estimated to have a generation time of about 15 years. Observed and estimated population reductions of about 80% have been noted over a combination of the past two generations (30 years) and predicted for the next 15 years (45 years total for three generations), qualifying the species for an assessed conservation status of Critically Endangered (CR A4abcd). The species<em>&#160;</em>was previously assessed for the IUCN Red List in 1996 as Vulnerable (VU A1bd) (ver. 2.3) and provisionally assessed as Critically Endangered (CR) by the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group in 2013 at the Sub-Saharan African Turtle and Tortoise Red Listing Workshop.","<em>Malacochersus tornieri</em>&#160;is a small, flat, and soft-shelled tortoise of up to about 17.8 cm carapace length, rarely weighing more than 500 g. It has a flat and pliable shell resulting from limited bony shell development with a covering of thin keratinous scutes. The flat shape and shell pliability are fundamental adaptations which have enabled the species to successfully utilize rock crevice microhabitats in East Africa.&#160;It is an inhabitant of arid thorn-bush and savanna landscapes, where it lives on hills with rocky outcrops (kopjes) (Loveridge and Williams 1957; Broadley 1989; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). Superimposing the species’ distribution map and vegetation maps of Spawls <em>et al</em>. (2002) indicates the species to inhabit predominantly dry savanna regions with 250 to 500 mm annual rainfall, with populations ranging into adjacent areas of semi-desert as well as moist savanna. Individual Pancake Tortoises are usually found in fissures and crevices in and between boulders and bedrock. Remarkable places in which some animals have been found include fissures high up in towering rocks, and in vertical clefts in boulders where tortoises have to climb up the boulder and slide down into the cleft (Broadley 1989).&#160;It is associated with isolated rocky hills and outcrops (kopjes) within its range, where it hides in crevices between and under exfoliating slabs of pre-Cambrian rock (gneiss) where it has a limited home range and exhibits high site fidelity&#160;(Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species is not a migrant, but periodic, local movement between crevices has been observed (Moll and Klemens 1996; Malonza 2003; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Pancake Tortoises are reported to eat a variety of herbs and succulent plants, and to like flowers. Analysis of faeces has shown that they also eat tenebrionid and scarabid beetles (Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002). Loveridge and Williams (1957) noted that the species apparently emerges to feed only during the early morning hours. Due to the cryptic nature of the species, most information on reproduction derives from a mixture of <em>in situ</em> wild observations, <em>in situ</em> captive observations, and general captive observations. Mating has been recorded in the range in January and February, and a single or occasionally two large elongate eggs are laid annually at the beginning of the rainy season&#160;(Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002; Schmidt 2006; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Hatchlings measure 32–47 mm straight carapace length and weigh about 10–23 g (Shaw 1970; Wilke 1984; Ewert <em>et al</em>. 2004; Dathe 2005).","The single most serious human threat to <em>Malacochersus tornieri</em> is overexploitation for the live exotic animal trade (Klemens and Moll 1995; Luiijf 1997; Malonza 2003; Goh and O’Riordan 2007; Nijman and Shepherd 2007; Ngwava 2015; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). Overexploitation for trade can rapidly deplete previously stable populations of&#160;<em>M. tornieri</em>, as recolonization is limited due to the species' limited movement (small home range and high site fidelity). All available and suitable&#160;<em>M. tornieri&#160;</em>micro-habitats in any given area can be easily identified, with many animals extracted and the population depleted and possibly extirpated in a very short time. Habitat degradation from rock destruction that reduces available habitat is also an important threat, especially as related to illegal tortoise collection (range-wide), construction purposes and slab and ballast extraction in Kenya, and kiln building for charcoal production in Zambia (Klemens and Moll 1995; Malonza 2003; Goode <em>et al</em>. 2005; Chansa and Wagner 2006). Vegetation removal through slash-and-burn cultivation, wildfires and charcoal burning (Wood and MacKay 1997; Malonza 2003; Ngwava, 2015) are also detrimental to the species because they are likely to negatively affect the ability to feed, and increase exposure to predation and thermal stress (Mwaya 2006, 2009). Livestock grazing does not seem to be as big a problem for Pancake Tortoises as the other various human activities, as it results in little destruction of crevice microhabitats (Malonza 2003).&#160;Female members of the Hadza are known to eat this tortoise in Tanzania, but the impact on the populations is considered to be minimal (Klemens 1992; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).","The status of <em>Malacochersus tornieri</em>&#160;subpopulations in the wild is incompletely known, but many are decreasing (Honegger 1964; Klemens and Moll 1995; Malonza 2003; Ngwava 2015; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). Species abundance varies from one area to another and appears to be a function of habitat quality, including the presence of appropriately oriented and well-exfoliated rock crevices with suitable interior dimensions (Moll and Klemens 1996, Malonza 2003). Other aspects of microhabitat quality include the degree of herbaceous vegetation cover over rock outcrops (Malonza 2003;&#160;Mwaya 2009), and the extent of anthropogenic habitat alteration (Wood and MacKay 1997; Chansa and Wagner 2006; Kyalo 2008). Low tortoise&#160;population densities in otherwise seemingly suitable habitat also result from removal and offtake by commercial collectors (Klemens and Moll 1995; Malonza 2003; Ngwava 2015; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Kenya, recorded species densities in appropriate habitats have ranged from 8.86 tortoises/km<sup>2</sup> in Voo, Kitui County (Malonza 2003), to as low as 1.2 tortoises/km<sup>2</sup> in Nguni, Kitui County (Malonza 2003, Kyalo 2008). The low density in the Nguni area was due to past collection, as this was the only area where the species was earlier known to occur in Kenya (Wood and MacKay 1997). However, even relatively high-density subpopulations such as those at Voo can become rapidly depleted. Ngwava (2015) found no Pancake Tortoises there when resurveying Voo in 2014. Notably, a commercial farming operation for Pancake Tortoises had been established near Voo and was still operational in 2014; it is likely that the local wild population may have been collected to provide some breeding stock for the farm (Ngwava 2015; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). A few other areas in Kenya surveyed by Malonza (2003) that had good Pancake Tortoise subpopulations at that time were also noted by Ngwava (2015) to be depleted in 2014. In Tanzania, commercial Pancake Tortoise farms inspected by Malonza (2001) appeared to be conduits for wild-collected animals.&#160;<br/><br/>In Zambia, 66 animals were found at eight sites in Nakonde District which were inhabited by 2–25 individuals per site (Chansa and Wagner 2006). Based upon a mark-recapture study conducted at eight sites in suitable habitat at Nakonde District, a population size estimate of 518 animals was obtained by ZAWA (2000) and a density of 11 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Chansa and Wagner 2006).",Decreasing,"<em>Malacochersus tornieri </em>occurs in Kenya, Tanzania, and marginally in Zambia (Iverson 1992; Spawls et al. 2002; Malonza 2003; Chansa and Wagner 2006;&#160;TTWG 2017; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). In Kenya, it occurs disjunctly from northern, northeastern, and central areas southward into the southeastern part of the country, all within the Somalia-Maasai floristic zone on the Precambrian Basement system, creating two subpopulations north and south of the volcanic Nyambene Hills. In Tanzania it occurs disjunctly from the southern shores of Lake Victoria into the Maasai Steppe and further south on Precambrian Basement in the Somalia-Maasai and the Zambesian Floristic Regions. In Zambia it has only been reported from a single site in northern Nakonde District. While the area of occupancy (AOO)&#160;and extent of occurrence (EOO) appear moderate to large, the actual suitable micro-habitat (rocky areas with appropriate crevices) constitute only a very small proportion of the calculated AOO.","<em>Malacochersus tornieri</em> is a popular species in the global pet trade, and is traded in significant numbers. Gross export numbers from the CITES Trade database (<a href=""http://www.unep-wcmc-apps.org/citestrade/report.cfm"">http://www.unep-wcmc-apps.org/citestrade/report.cfm</a>) indicate that the highest export numbers predictably are from the range countries Kenya (4,749 animals 1978-1981, 1996-1999, 2005-06, 2010 onwards) and Tanzania (19,505 animals from 1985 onwards); the export numbers from Zambia are remarkable given the small known area of occurrence (17,160 live animals exported since 1995, 6,400 in 2011 alone). Declared exports (without corresponding import records) from Mozambique (2,850 animals in 1997-1998) and Congo (DRC) (3,700 live animals 1999-2007), and a&#160; confiscation of 209 animals at Entebbe Airport, Uganda in 2000, indicate the likelihood of extensive illegal trade and corresponding complications of monitoring trade in this species and its impact on populations. As well as removing animals, collectors often destroy habitat in process of collecting, using crowbars and jacks to open suitable refuges (Klemens and Moll 1995; Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002; Malonza 2003; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).",Terrestrial,"<em>Malacochersus tornieri</em> has been listed in CITES Appendix II since 1975, regulating its international trade with the aim that such trade should not be detrimental to the survival of the species or its ecological role across its natural range. A proposal to transfer the species to Appendix I, which would have resulted in a suspension of international trade for commercial purposes, was submitted and then withdrawn at CITES CoP11 in 2000.&#160;Kenya discontinued exporting <em>M. tornieri</em> from the wild in 1981, but a few farms are authorized to breed for export. However, enforcement is a challenge and illegal collection and export of wild-collected as purportedly captive-bred specimens is highly likely since there is no established marking system. Hence, tortoise farms may act as conduits for export of wild specimens.&#160;A significant milestone in Pancake Tortoise conservation in Tanzania emerged following imposition of an export quota moratorium in 1992 (Kabigumila 1998), and allowance for the private sector to captive-breed the species for live trade demand (MNRT 1998). Currently, at least four farms have been licensed to breed the Pancake Tortoise in Tanzania (Kabigumila 1998; Mbassa and Maganga 2002). The moratorium was lifted in 2018, based on the assurances of Tanzania that there are no intentions to resume the export of specimens collected from the wild ( page 8 of <a href=""https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02.pdf"">https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02.pdf</a>; page 54 of <a href=""https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02-A2.pdf"">https://cites.org/sites/default/files/eng/com/sc/70/E-SC70-29-02-A2.pdf</a>).&#160;In Zambia, international trade in Pancake Tortoises was suspended for a while because “laundered” animals from East Africa had presumably been exported from there previously. The suspension held until the suspected presence of natural populations there was verified and its size evaluated by ZAWA (2000). However, no protection of the area known to support Pancake Tortoise populations in Zambia is provided by ZAWA (Chansa and Wagner 2006).&#160;In Tanzania, Pancake Tortoise populations have been reported from 4 of 16 gazetted national parks, namely Serengeti, Tarangire, Ruaha, and Mkomazi. National parks in Tanzania are fairly comprehensively protected and are considered ecological benchmarks (Sinclair <em>et al</em>. 2002). In Kenya, about 95% of the total <em>M. tornieri</em> population occurs outside protected areas, where the best habitat also occurs. Pancake Tortoise presence has been confirmed in the following protected areas, from south to north: Tsavo East National Park (northern sector), Kitui South, Shaba, Buffalo Springs and Samburu National Reserves, and Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy (Malonza 2003; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). It has also been recorded in some adjacent Laikipia Conservancies (Malonza, unpubl. data).&#160;Across its entire range, Bombi <em>et al</em>. (2013) estimated that only 22.6% of <em>M. tornieri</em> habitat is currently protected. The fact that a majority of the species’ populations occur outside protected areas predispose them to illegal collection for live trade as well as to anthropogenic habitat disturbance.There is a need to promote other non-exploitative economic activities and provide incentives that are linked with community enterprise and alternative livelihoods to reduce local community overexploitation of the species and destruction of its habitat or micro-habitats. There is a need for eco-friendly and sustainable-use initiatives such as eco-tourism; these can reduce the direct reliance on exploitation with environmental resources that affect the species and its habitat.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
1008712,163440,Pelusios niger,Near Threatened,A4cde; C1,2019,2018-05-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Pelusios niger</em>&#160;is threatened by local subsistence trade and consumption, localized habitat destruction and degradation, especially from pollution in the Niger Delta due to oil spills, and the international pet trade. Although fairly common at some sites, its overall distribution is limited and overall population declines of 10–15% are estimated to have occurred over the previous two generations (30 years) and predicted to continue over the next one generation (15 years), for an ongoing decline of 15–20% over three generations (45 years). As such, the species just qualifies as Near Threatened (NT) under criterion A4cde following a very precautionary approach (normally reductions of 20-25% would be required to qualify a species for an NT listing). However, given that there has been an ongoing decline of more than 10% for three generations, the species qualifies for listing as NT under criterion C1. The species was previously assessed as Least Concern for the IUCN Red List in 1996, but not published since LC species were not listed at that time. It was re-assessed as Near Threatened at the IUCN Red Listing workshop on African chelonians organized by the IUCN Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group in Lomé, Togo, in August 2013.","<em>Pelusios niger</em>&#160;occurs in the rainforest region in a variety of standing and slow-flowing permanent waters, including lakes, lagoons, and marshes, as well as rivers (Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is often seen on land and can also be found in ephemeral waterbodies, especially during the wet season (Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012). It feeds on shellfish, mollusks, fish and aquatic vegetation (Luiselli 2008; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). Data available on the reproductive biology of <em>P. niger</em> in the field are scarce. A female of 22 cm CL had a clutch of 10 eggs measuring 47–49 mm long and 24–25 mm wide, with a mass of 17–18 g each (Maran and Pauwels 2005). In the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria, clutch size ranged from 18–28 with an average of 25 ± 2, and eggs measured 30–40 mm in length (mean, 35.5 ± 4 mm) (Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015c). Mean hatchling size was 40 × 33 mm carapace length and width (F. Grünewald, unpubl. data). Age at maturity is probably about 6-8 years at carapace lengths of ca. 10-12 cm (males) and about 15 cm (females), generation time is estimated to be about 15 years, and longevity is at least 20-25 years. Maximum size of females is about 26.5 cm carapace length, and males are larger, reaching about 34.7 cm in carapace length (Maran 2006). Weight varies considerably among individuals, however, an average female of about 20 cm carapace length may be 1100-1300 g, whereas an average male of about 26 cm carapace length may be 2,100-2,300 g with captive individuals being slightly heavier (F. Grünewald, unpubl. data).","The major threats for this species include local subsistence consumption, habitat destruction and degradation, especially from pollution in the Niger Delta due to oil spills, and the international pet trade (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<em>Pelusios niger</em> is widespread in eastern West Africa and locally abundant in several places in its range, but is regularly collected by humans for food (e.g., Branch 2007; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2013; Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015a,b,c). In Gabon, because of its large size, the species is particularly sought after for local consumption, especially in the lakes around Lambaréné (Gramentz 1999; Maran and Pauwels 2005; Maran 2006). Its flesh and eggs are greatly appreciated. <em>Pelusios niger</em> is caught by fishing or more occasionally with a trammel. In the dry season, turtles inhabiting swamps hide in tangles of aquatic plants. Using their machete or a simple piece of sharpened wood, hunters probe these areas and are able to capture a large number of turtles. Locally, the species is affected by pollution and degradation of its primary habitats: in the Niger Delta of Nigeria, for instance, several populations are collapsing due to the effects of oil spill contaminations (Luiselli and Akani 2003; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006a,b). It is often exported from Africa for sale to turtle hobbyists, with Ghana (animals trans-shipped primarily from Nigeria) and Benin being the main exporting countries (Ineich 2006; Segniagbeto 2009).","<p><em>Pelusios niger</em> is a species of limited distribution, poorly represented in museum collections, although sometimes reaching high local abundance, as in the swamps and coastal streams of Gabon and Nigeria (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). Local declines appear to have occurred at some sites in the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria. For instance, the species tends to be quickly extirpated from sites subjected to oil spillages (Luiselli and Akani 2003; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2006a). Overall, there is no evidence yet that population declines rangewide are generalized in a major way, although no long-term monitoring data on any natural populations are available. However, much of its natural habitat, which includes water bodies within the forest block of eastern coastal West Africa and coastal Cameroon and Gabon (Maran 2006) is under severe threat due to industrial expansion and deforestation (Akani <em>et al</em>. 1999; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000), and population declines of at least 10-15% over the last 30 years (two generations) are estimated.</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Pelusios niger</em> is a coastal West African species that ranges from Benin continuously through coastal southern Nigeria and western Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea to southwestern coastal Gabon (Trape<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012; TTWG 2017; Luiselli&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018).

(2018), given that the main threats to this species are local (bushmeat) consumption and habitat loss, monitoring of trends in bushmeat markets (numbers offered, average size of animals traded) should be carried out. Populations in areas affected by oil pollution should be monitored, and population monitoring at a few key protected areas would be justified. Also, more conservation biology research would be desirable, including data on hatchling size, incubation time, age and size at maturity, longevity, annual reproductive output, etc. Export quantities for the international pet trade should also be continuously monitored in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the trade on wild population sizes and to adjust export quotas as necessary.

Within larger water bodies, it specifically seeks out areas with emerging shrubs and vegetation in sheltered coves and embayments, while reedbeds are also used. Hatchlings and juveniles utilize flooded forest habitats. All known localities are below 500 m altitude (review by Gramentz 2008).&#160;<em>Cycloderma aubryi</em>&#160;feeds on fish, crab and crayfish; juveniles are thought to feed on insects as well (Gramentz 1999, 2008; Maran 2002; Maran and Pauwels 2005).&#160;<em>Cycloderma aubryi</em>&#160;reaches at least 50 cm SCL and 15 kg, and females may exceed 60 cm and 18 kg&#160;(overview by Gramentz 2008).

Maran (2002) recorded capture rates of up to 30 <em>Cycloderma</em> per week [per fisherman] in Gabon, and Maran and Pauwels (2005) considered that targeted capture has a profound negative impact on the population size, at least in the regions of Ogooué-Maritime and Moyen-Ogooué in Gabon.

Habitats include karroid fynbos in the south to mesic thicket, arid and mesic savanna, thorn scrub, and grassland as you move northeastward in the range. Leopard Tortoises can be found from sea-level to about 2,900 m altitude (Hailey and Coulson 1995, Mason <em>et al</em>. 2000, Malonza <em>et al</em>. 2006, Branch, 2008).<br/><br/>Diet includes a wide variety of plants such as seasonal annuals, grasses, succulents and forbs (parts include leaves, flowers, seeds). Occasional ingestion of dried carcass, bone, ash, or feces has also been observed (Milton 1992, Rall and Fairall 1993, Kabigumila 2001, Busson and Loehr 2011).&#160;<em>Stigmochelys</em>&#160;is known to be an important seed disperser in Addo Elephant National Park, where its biomass exceeds that of most other herbivores. As it does not “chew cud” like most mammalian herbivores, seeds pass intact through the digestive tract. It is therefore of greater significance as a seed-disperser than ungulates (Milton 1992, Mason 1995).<br/><br/>Size tends to vary geographically with larger individuals in mesic habitat at both the northern and southern extremes of its range (individuals known to reach up to 70 cm). In the central savanna of East Africa animals are around 30-45 cm (Lambert 1995, Branch 2008, Fritz <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females grow faster than males, females are heavier, and tortoises reach sexual maturity at about 12 to 15 years. Tortoise are known to live from 30 to 75 years in captivity (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Branch 2008). Nesting takes place from May to June or from October to November depending on latitude. Female Leopard Tortoises lay 6-15 (exceptionally up to 30) spherical hard-shelled eggs and may have multiple clutches (3-7) during a breeding season. Incubation period varies from 8-15 months depending on temperatures (Bonin <em>et al</em>. 2006, Branch 2008).<br/><br/>Natural predators on young/eggs include monitor lizards, snakes, honey badgers, jackals, mongoose, eagles, and crows; however, adult tortoises have also been reported to be preyed upon by lions in Kruger National Park and hyena in Bwabwata National Park (Broadley 1989, Bonin <em>et al</em>. 2006, Branch, 2008, Hanssen and Cunningham, 2012).</p><p></p>","<p> Declines in some areas of East Africa have been attributed to unsustainable harvest for the pet trade. Some tortoises in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania) have also been known to be killed by frequent fires common in this region, although the species is perceived to hold stable overall. In South Sudan, habitat burning impacts may be sufficiently widespread to have impacted populations.<br/><br/>In South Africa deaths  as the result of electric fences meant to keep out mammalian predators can be a significant factor (Participants, Sub-Saharan African tortoise &amp; freshwater turtle red listing workshop, August 2013).<br/><br/>Concern has been expressed about the potential of collection of (mainly) adults for human consumption, with the influx of foreign contractors and purchasing power associated with large-scale development projects, as well as improved transport logistics and economic activity between Africa and East Asia in recent years. While no significant impacts on<em> S. pardalis</em> have been recorded to date, analogy with Asian tortoise populations indicates that the possibility of severe and sudden impact should not be ignored.&#160;</p>","<p> Overall population estimates for this species are unknown but Bonin <em>et al</em>. (2006) refer to populations as being “still numerous”. McDougal (2000) reported that tortoises across their range are rare in regions with high human populations (overharvesting) and consequently in areas with low human populations, tortoise populations are “apparently secure”. This species was recorded in consistently high numbers in northern Tanzania (Kabigumila 2001) and is common in most Tanzanian protected areas (J. Kabigumila and Mwaya pers. comms. at workshop August 2013). Boycott and Bourquin (2000) considered this species to be in low densities over its range in South Africa. A study in the Thicket Biome of the Eastern Cape in South Africa found a density of 0.85 tortoises per hectare (Mason <em>et al</em>. 2000). A population estimate of 57.6 ± 4.0 tortoises in a 5,500 ha area was obtained in a study done in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa and this is a lower density than populations found in more mesic areas (McMaster and Downs 2006). Population numbers in East African savanna habitat may be lower than in the more mesic northern (Ethiopian highlands) and southern (Thicket biome, South Africa) habitats where fire is not a dominant component of ecosystems. Overall there is no evidence of range contractions or local extinctions (Branch 2008). Participants at the Sub-Saharan African tortoise &amp; freshwater turtle red listing workshop (August 2013) considered that the species is generally common in southern Africa, where it is subject to a variety of threats, but not at levels where impacts on populations have been documented. &#160; </p>",Unknown,"<p> <em>Stigmochelys pardalis</em> occurs widely through the arid and savanna regions of eastern and southern Africa, from South Sudan and Somalia to Namibia and South Africa.  The species is generally absent from the humid forest regions of central Africa. (Ernst and Barbour 1989, Iverson 1992, Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002 and Branch 2008).</p>","<p> Leopard Tortoises are infrequently eaten by some ethnic groups (such as in Zambia) within its range (Lambert 1995, Bonin 2006). In Somalia Leopard Tortoises are collected mainly for medicinal purposes and considered as aphrodisiac and the turtle-derived medicines are specially used to treat lung diseases such as tuberculosis, asthma and cough.&#160;Small Leopard Tortoises are occasionally killed and eaten by pastoralists in southern Ethiopia and their empty shells are used as cowbells (P.J. Baker pers. comm. 2013).&#160;The Ikoma tribe of Northern Tanzania considers the leopard tortoise as a totem animal, and the scutes have medicinal value (Kabigumila 1998). An increasing demand of tortoise bones in China and Southeast Asia may apparently encourage the collection of leopard tortoises in Somalia. (Amir 2007).<br/><br/>Trade was reported in Mto wa Mbu (Northern Tanzania), however, most of the local people who collect tortoises did it as an alternative source to supplement their income. Animals caught were sold to dealers from Arusha, and only occasionally to local middlemen (Kabigumila 1998). Some animals are understood to be traded from Ethiopia to East Africa and onwards into the global trade (Participants, Sub-Saharan African tortoise &amp; freshwater turtle red listing workshop, August 2013).<br/><br/>Between 1977 and 2011 – 339,813 live tortoises were in international trade (49% Zambia exports; 14% Mozambique Exports; 12% El Salvador exports; 11% Tanzania exports) the majority (80%) were declared as captive bred. That demand has steadily grown from less than 30 animals per year in 1977 to more than 30,000 per year by 2011. The highest importing countries are Japan, Hong Kong, U.S., Netherlands, and Spain (UNEP-WCMC 2013).<br/><br/>Most exports from Kenya and Tanzania originate from captive breeding operations, with little collection from the wild recorded, and it is understood that the breeding operations relieve collection pressure on the wild population.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p> The Leopard Tortoise has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1975. Tanzania  has had a zero annual export quota for specimens removed from the wild and traded for primarily commercial purposes since 2009, and the Congo (DRC) has been under a trade suspension for this species since 2001 (CITES, Notification 2013/013 ). In 2001 the USDA enacted a prohibition on the importation of African land tortoises including <em>S. pardalis </em>into the United States because of the risk posed by Heartwater disease, an acute, infectious disease carried by ticks and affecting ruminants, to the US livestock industry (Smith and Redding, 2001).  </p>Leopard Tortoises occur in multiple protected areas throughout the range including Awash National Park (NP),&#160;Mago NP,&#160;Nechisar NP,&#160;and Omo NP&#160;in Ethiopia (Fife 2012;&#160;Baker pers. comm. 2013); Tana River Primate National Reserve in Kenya (Malonza <em>et al</em>.&#160;2006); Bwabwata NP in Namibia (Hanssen and Cunningham 2012); Kruger NP, Bontebok NP, Karoo NP, Addo Elephant Park, Mountain Zebra NP, and the Franklin Nature Reserve in South Africa (Grobler 1982, Broadley 1989, Bonin 2006, Douglas and Rall 2006); Arusha NP, Serengeti NP, Lake Manyara NP, and Tarangire NP in Tanzania (Kabigumila 1995, Razzetti and Andekia Msuya 2002);&#160;and&#160;Sengwa Wildlife Research Area in Zimbabwe (Hailey and Coulson 1995).<br/><br/>Human traditional beliefs offer protection against local exploitation in parts of its range, as this tortoise is often respected in local traditions and generally left unharmed when found (Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>This species is readily bred in captivity (Mislin 2006, Velensky and Velenska 2006, Fife 2012). In Tanzania, the species is farmed to supply the legal export trade (Kabigumila 1998). However, it was found on occasion that the farms were not abiding by quota regulations and the tortoises did not have adequate enclosures, diet, veterinary attention and clean water, resulting in a reproductive output that was poor and likely unable to keep up with the trade demand (Kabigumila 1998).<br/><br/>Trade in Leopard Tortoises needs to be monitored carefully, particularly of larger, adult animals, in view of potential consumption trade to urban areas and to East Asia.<br/><br/>More genetic work is recommended to identify conservation units; recent work (Fritz <em>et al</em>. 2010) identified seven genetic lineages, of which five occur in South Africa, with some likely endemic to the country.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Studies in the Carangola River started in 1992, when an index of population size was first obtained based on capture success using Fike nets in an area of 5.0 km of river stream. From October 2000 to June 2002 the same methodology was applied along the 150 km of the Carangola River, from the headwaters to the estuary, and turtles were captured in about 40 km of the main channel (Moreira 2003).&#160;From October 2008 to December 2015, the same area was sampled and turtles were found in only 15 km of the main Carangola River (Drummond <em>et al</em>. 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Drummond <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data).&#160;The total number of turtles captured ranged from 20 in 1992 to 147 in 2015, but capture success, calculated as the number of turtles captured by unit effort, decreased steadily from 0.71 in 1992 to 0.05 in 2015. The trend in the index of population size was calculated based on the regression slope (1-e<sup>-ß</sup>), showing that since 1992, the population in the Carangola River had been declining at a mean annual rate of 16.2%, and is expected to experience local extinction in less than seven years’ time if no conservation actions are adopted&#160;(Drummond <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data).

Sexual maturity of females is estimated as 10-12 years, with nesting apparently occurring in the spring and summer (August/September through February/March). Clutch size in a female measuring 252 mm CL was nine eggs with an average egg size of 33.3 by 27.0 mm (Rhodin and Mittermeier 1983).

Individuals are often observed basking on banks or fallen trunks along the shoreline, either alone or in groups including various size classes (Gallego-Garcia and Castaño-Mora 2008; Restrepo <em>et al</em>. 2008<a>). Smaller individuals tend to occur in shallower, more turbid waters or in flooded pastures, with adults more selective of deeper, wider channels (Gallego-García and Castaño-Mora 2008; Páez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015a).<br/></a><br/>Nesting occurs in sand or gravel beaches, as well as in banks and pastures during the months of low river levels. Mean clutch sizes is 22 eggs, with a range of 10-31 eggs (Dahl and Medem 1964; Medem 1965; Castaño-Mora 1986; Correa-Hernández 2006; Cano 2007; Gallego-García and Castaño-Mora 2008).&#160;                  Based upon a sample size of approximately 1000 individuals (Páez, unpubl. data) adult males on average measure 24.6 cm SCL (range 20-35 cm) with an average weight of 1.6 kg (range 0.7-4.3 kg), while adult females average 37 cm SCL (range 30-46 cm) and on average weigh 5.6 kg (range 2,2-10.4 kg). Hatchlings measure 42-46 mm SCL and weigh 16-22 gram. It has been documented that <em>P. lewyana</em> nests are laid in both the verano and veranillo low water periods each year, but it is not clear whether individual females nest in both periods each year. However, within each period, there is wide variance around the female size/clutch size regression. This often results in species where females of a given body size lay progressively smaller clutches when re-nesting during a nesting season. It is suspected that female <em>P. lewyana</em> in the study population deposited one or more nests during both nesting seasons each year.&#160;Males attain sexual maturity at approximately 20 cm SCL, corresponding to 3-4 years of age. Females first nest at 30 cm SCL, at an approximate age of 5-6 years old. The generation time is approximately 10 years (Páez <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2014, González-Zarate <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ortiz-Yusti <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sánchez-Ospina <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zapata <em>et al</em>. 2014, Restrepo <em>et al</em>. 2015, Gallego-García and Páez 2016, Páez <em>et al.</em> 2015a,b).&#160; According to Gallego-Garcia and Forero-Medina (in prep.), <em>P. lewyana</em> has high site fidelity, with males and females exhibiting comparable home range sizes (10.3 ha and 14.6 ha, respectively). In the middle Magdalena drainage, the main nesting season is during the primary dry season, from December to April, with a peak in March, and limited nesting also occurring in the secondary dry season from July to August. In the Prado River of the upper Magdalena drainage, the main nesting period is from June to September and a secondary nesting period occurs from December to May (Vargas-Ramirez, unpubl. data). In the Sinú River, two seasons also have been documented in December to March and June to August (Gallego-García and Castaño-Mora 2008).</p>","<p>Páez <em>et al</em>. (2009, 2012) provided and extensive review of the threats to&#160;<em>P. lewyana</em>.&#160;Several factors that affect populations of the species have been identified throughout its distributional range: 1) habitat destruction and pollution; 2) traditional utilization and consumption; 3) commercial exploitation; and 4) hydrological changes due to dams (Gallego-Garcia 2004; Vargas-Ramirez <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2007b). Pastures and plantations have replaced original forest throughout a large portion of its territory. At urban centres and localities where extensive agriculture is the principal human activity (e.g., the upper Magdalena River), pollution of beaches and water bodies is common. <em>Podocnemis lewyana</em> is used as a source of protein for local people throughout its range. Various capture techniques are used, including hunting adult females with dogs on land during the nesting season, or in water by setting nets and hooks baited with plantain, or diving for individuals along the bottom of canals. In several fishing villages, turtles are also considered important for traditional medicinal purposes. In these communities, it is believed that consumption of turtles helps women to recover after pregnancy, cures skin and eye diseases, confers longevity and strength, and serves as an aphrodisiac. The nesting season includes Easter week each year, when hunting pressures rise notably to satisfy the demand for “white meat” in the large cities on the nearby Caribbean coast.

A projection matrix was constructed from the data from the four sites and a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis indicated the population was declining at an annual rate of 8.8%. An elasticity analysis indicated that the most important parameter for helping the population recover was survival of adults, followed by survival of other age classes, with survival of eggs and hatchlings having the least effect.

While nest transfer is obviously justified for populations that suffer nest loss each nesting season due to flooding caused by hydroelectic plant water discharges, the method, combined with head-starting, is probably not justifiable for other populations. Projection matrix analyses indicate that even with a 100% increase in egg and hatchling survival thanks to such management efforts, most populations would continue to decline at slightly lower rates. In contrast, efforts to reduce adult mortality via education campaigns with fishing communities, protection of nesting females on beaches, and other improvements to enforcement of legislation for protecting adults could reverse declines and permit population recoveries.&#160;</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

In Iraq, various wars and political conflicts, drought, dam construction, unsustainable fishing methods, especially electro-fishing, and the use of poisons and explosive materials are the main concerns for <em>Rafetus </em>survival.

At an estimated generation time of 25 years (by analogy with <em>B. affinis</em>), total population decline has exceeded 90% over the past three generations (here estimated as three times the time of maturity) as a result of exploitation of eggs and adults as well as habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation and the decline is projected to continue into the future, hence the species also qualifies for listing as CR under criteria A2acd+4cd.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<em>Batagur baska</em> is a highly aquatic turtle species, associated with estuarine river sections, with nesting taking place on large on sand banks. It feeds primarily on riverside plants and fruits, however, it also consumes molluscs and has been observed to accept a variety of animal matter in captivity (Moll 1980). Females mature at 45 cm carapace length and may reach 60 cm; males mature at around 40 cm carapace length and can reach up to 49 cm (Moll 1985). Breeding maturity may occur at an age of nine years in captivity, but requires up to 25 years in rivers with modest productivity (Moll 1980). Females only produce a single clutch per year of about 18-33 eggs (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).","<p><em>Batagur baska</em> has been exploited long-term for local subsistence and ritualistic consumption as well as some regional trade, including supply to the Calcutta markets in the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Harvest of its eggs has been extensive as the eggs are highly prized for consumption and can be collected at known sites at predictable times.<br/><br/>The species’ use of estuarine and mangrove habitats and sandy nesting beaches means it has been significantly impacted by habitat loss, as estuaries are prime locations for human settlement and industrial development, mangrove areas are cleared for fuelwood and for shrimp and other aquaculture development, and sandy banks and beaches are exploited for sand as building material and tourist developments.<br/><br/>The extent of threat posed by entanglement in fishing nets, the effects of altered water flow from hydrological mega-projects (dams, reservoirs, river diversion) on nesting sites and habitat in general, or habitat pollution, have not been documented as specific threats, but have likely impacted the species.<br/><br/>Seizure records from illegal trade have reported both <em>B. affinis </em>and<em> B. baska </em>as<em> ‘Batagur baska</em>’; at least 139 live specimens of one of these two species were reported as seized from 6 illegal trade shipments during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73).&#160;</p>","<p>In the 1980s a moderate to large breeding population of <em>Batagur baska</em> was thought to exist in the Sunderbans of Bangladesh (Moll 1985).

Praschag pers. comm 2018). There are 8 females and about 26 males, with 230 juveniles in captivity (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Populations of <em>Batagur baska</em> in the Sunderbans in India were considered abundant in the 19th Century, but had declined to very small populations by the 1970s (Moll 1985) and to an estimated 10 breeding females by 1995 (Choudhury et al. 2000). The total Indian population was estimated as fewer than 40 animals, with about three nests produced per year, although there was hope that more animals and/or nesting sites might exist and be found with intensive survey efforts (Lucknow Red List Workshop participants, 2005). Participants at the 2011 Singapore Red List Workshop estimated that about 30 adult animals remained.&#160;In India, there are 8 males and 7 females; and 300 juveniles in captivity (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Myanmar: Historically <em>Batagur baska</em> was numerous in the Ayeyarwady delta in Myanmar (Maxwell 1911), but populations had declined to a few nesting animals in the early 1980s (Moll 1985) and there are apparently no records from the wild in recent years, despite surveys. Currently, only three females remain in two pagoda ponds (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In Austria, there are two males, three females and 15 juveniles held in an assurance colony (P.

Populations in New Guinea (<em>ca</em> 90% of the global population) are under significant threats, especially in Indonesian Papua, and have declined by <em>ca</em> 57% in representative markets in Papua New Guinea in the 30-yr period between <em>ca</em> 1980 and 2010, with predictions of continued declines of at least 60% over three generations, including past, present, and future.&#160;In&#160;Indonesian Papua, eggs are also collected for local incubation under controlled conditions for sale of hatchlings into the international pet trade; total numbers of eggs collected amounted to 1.5 to 2 million eggs annually in the late 1990s and have continued at unsustainable and growing rates into the present, despite being listed on CITES Appendix II. Frequent seizures of illegal shipments of hatchlings as well as body parts have occurred recently. As a result of these combined threats and monitored population declines, this species is now assessed as Endangered under criteria A2bd and A4bd, but could quickly reach Critically Endangered status unless current threats and exploitation are curtailed. The species was first listed as Insufficiently Known in the 1982 Red Data Book, then uplisted to Vulnerable on the 1996 Red List.","In New Guinea,<em>&#160;Carettochelys insculpta</em>&#160;inhabits rivers, including their deltas and estuarine reaches, grassy lagoons, swamps, lakes, and waterholes of the southern lowlands (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2015a, b). In Australia, the species appears restricted to seasonally clear, shallow, continuously-flowing waters of the Daly drainage and to billabongs and plunge pools of the Alligator Rivers region (Webb <em>et al</em>. 1986; Georges and Kennett 1989; Doody <em>et al</em>. 2001a, 2002; Georges <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2008). The species is omnivorous, but feeds principally on fruits, leaves, and stems of riparian vegetation, and aquatic plants, with some molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish, and mammals (likely eaten as carrion) also consumed (Georges <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2008, and references therein).&#160;<em>Carettochelys</em>&#160;females may reach up to 57 cm carapace length (CL) and mature at 38 cm CL (Daly River) to 41 cm (Kikori region) or larger. Maturity in females appears to be reached at about 25 yrs, with generation time of <em>ca</em> 30–40 years (Heaphy 1990).<br/> <br/>Female turtles nest gregariously at night on riverside or coastal marine sandbanks, and appear to produce two clutches every second year, with a non-reproducing year in between (Doody <em>et al</em>. 2003a, b, 2009; Georges <em>et al</em>. 2008). Depending on location, average clutch size ranges from 10 (Daly River, Australia) to 21 eggs (Kikori region, Papua New Guinea), with a range of 7 to 26 or more. This species exhibits embryonic diapause and temperature-dependent sex determination, with females produced at warmer temperatures and males at lower temperatures&#160;(Webb <em>et al</em>. 1986, Young <em>et al</em>. 2004). Hatching is triggered by anoxia associated with torrential rain or flooding of the nest,&#160;and can expedited by sibling vibrations&#160;(Doody <em>et al</em>. 2001b, 2012). Incubation duration averages 65 days in Papua New Guinea and 72 days on the Daly River in Australia.&#160;Hatchlings measure 41–56 mm CL and weigh 21–30 g. Natural egg loss rates can be high from predation (up to 25%), notably by goannas&#160;(Doody <em>et al</em>. 2006), and flooding (up to 20%), or intrinsic issues (infertility, developmental problems, also up to 20%) (Georges <em>et al</em>. 2008, and references therein). The invasion of Cane Toads in 2003 into the Daly River boosted <em>C. insculpta</em> recruitment by <em>ca</em> 20% via population declines of Yellow-spotted Monitor Lizards (Doody <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Predation of adults occurs by Saltwater Crocodiles (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>).","<p><em>Carettochelys insculpta</em>&#160;is vulnerable by virtue of its relatively limited distribution and stereotyped nesting habits rendering it susceptible to over-exploitation. Adults and their eggs are highly regarded as food by indigenous peoples throughout its range, and exploitation for food is threatening populations in both Papua New Guinea and Indonesian Papua (Rhodin and Genorupa 2000, Samedi and Iskandar 2000). In one study, 92% of nests were lost to a combination of flooding and human egg collection (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015b). In addition, in Indonesian Papua, eggs are collected for local incubation under controlled conditions for sale of hatchlings into the international pet trade; total numbers of eggs collected amounted to 1.5 to 2 million eggs annually in the late 1990s, with the numbers of exports and confiscations gradually rising (Samedi and Iskandar 2000, Arida and Ibarrondo 2007, Georges <em>et al</em>. 2008, Burgess and Lilley 2014, and references therein). Exploitation of the species (eggs and adults alike) has been facilitated in recent years by the availability of outboard motors and the cessation of clan warfare, which now allows people to live along riverbanks (Georges<em>&#160;</em><em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2008, Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2015a, Burgess and Lilley 2014).<br/><br/>Habitat degradation is the major potential threat to Australian populations, involving water extraction for agriculture, pollution from mining, increased sedimentation, changes in water quality, and fragmentation of rivers (Georges <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;1993, 2008, and references therein). Trampling of nests, and damage to riparian vegetation, by feral Water Buffalo in the Alligators Rivers region of Australia were significant problems, but have been addressed by a buffalo reduction program (Georges <em>et al</em>. 2008, and references therein).<br/><br/>Most exploitation in Papua New Guinea occurs at the local level, with the cost of fuel for outboard motors the primary limiting factor; if fuel becomes more available, the offtake will expand and trade will extend to further areas (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2015a). In the Kikori River, about 2–3% of nests survive to hatching (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2011); goanna predation combined with human harvest amount to depredation of at least 92% of all eggs/nests deposited, usually up to 97–98%, and in some situations 100% of nests are destroyed before hatching.&#160;Local offtake can be significant: up to 23 females may be harvested in a single night in Papua New Guinea (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015a).&#160;Harvest monitoring through market surveys has documented dramatic declines in numbers traded despite increased local human population size and increased exploitation efforts over the ca. 30-yr period 1981–2008.<br/><br/>Impacts from human consumption are predicted to increase on the New Guinea <em>Carettochelys</em> populations with human population growth and human migration into turtle habitat. Recent available seizure records from 2017 (CITES document CoP17 Doc.73 Annex, p. 60) document 26 seizure cases comprising a combined total of 29,692 live specimens from primarily Indonesian Papua, plus two seizure cases of unspecified quantities of parts and derivatives, during the period 2000–2015. This makes&#160;<em>Carettochelys</em>&#160;the species with the second-largest number of seized live specimens of all tortoises and freshwater turtles world-wide.<em>&#160;</em></p>","Although statements regarding&#160;<em>Carettochelys</em>&#160;<em>insculpta</em> populations vary substantially, the species appears to be reasonably common in suitable habitat, although there is wide variance from locally rare to locally abundant, and populations are decreasing. Population densities for<em> C. insculpta</em> in the upper reaches of the South Alligator River in Australia have been estimated at 33.8 ± 11.3 turtles/ha (equivalent to 67 turtles/km of channel) (Georges and Kennett 1989). These estimates are comparatively high, and turtle densities were probably inflated above the carrying capacity of the waters in which they were found because of seasonal contractions of their aquatic habitat (Georges <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1993). Population in northern Australia (representing about 10% of the global population)&#160;appeared stable in 2009, populations in New Guinea (ca. 90% of global populations) were under significant threats, especially in Indonesian Papua. A decline of <em>ca</em> 57% was reported in the Kikori delta of Papua New Guinea over a 30-yr period between 1980 and 2010 and is likely to also be representative of other regions in Papua New Guinea (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2011).",Decreasing,"<em>Carettochelys insculpta</em> occurs in the rivers of southern New Guinea (both Papua, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea) and the rivers of the Northern Territory of Australia, where it occurs in the Victoria, Daly,&#160; Fitzmaurice, East Alligator, and South Alligator river systems, and possibly in other rivers. In New Guinea it occurs from the Gulf Province in Papua New Guinea to the Mimika region of western Papua, Indonesia; records from further west in West Papua at Lake Jamur appear to represent trade specimens (Iverson 1992, Cann 1998, Rhodin and Genorupa 2000, Georges <em>et al</em>. 2008, TTWG 2017).","Adults and eggs of <em>Carettochelys insculpta</em> are highly regarded as food by indigenous peoples throughout its range, and exploitation for food is threatening populations in both Papua New Guinea and Indonesian Papua (Rhodin and Genorupa 2000; Samedi and Iskandar 2000; Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015a).

In Papua New Guinea, export is strictly controlled, but domestic exploitation is largely unregulated. In West Papua, Indonesia, harvest of eggs for incubation and subsequent export of hatchlings as ‘captive-bred’ is managed by a quota system, while protective measures to prevent exploitation of mature animals is rarely enforced (Rhodin and Genorupa 2000, Samedi and Iskandar 2000, Georges <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2008, and references therein). <br/><br/>Significant subpopulations of pig-nosed turtles have been confirmed to inhabit Kakadu NP, Flora River Nature Park, and several Conservation Areas in the Northern Territory, Australia (Georges <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2008).

The species appears to be omnivorous; its recorded diet includes bamboo shoots, fruit, earth<span class=""longtext"">worms, and carrion. <span lang=""EN-GB"">Research on movement patterns, microhabitat use and other aspects of natural history have been carried out at the population of&#160;Diaoluoshan&#160;in Hainan, China (Wang <em>et al</em>.&#160;2011).&#160;Slow growth to maturity (10–15 yrs) is combined with low fecundity; clutch size in the wild in Hainan was 1–2, with shelled eggs found in April and oviposition from late May to early July (J. Wang <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). In captivity a single clutch of 1–3 eggs is seen each year in Cuc Phuong National Park where a small group is maintained (McCormack unpubl. data). Similar clutch sizes of 1–3 eggs have been reported from long-term captive animals kept in Europe and North America (de Bruin 1994; Struijk 2010). Generation time is conservatively estimated as 20 years.</span></span></p>","The primary threat to <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> has been collection for trade. The species continues to be in high demand in the international pet trade and the Asian consumption trade. Collection efforts include both targeted searches for turtles involving trained dogs, or occasionally pitfall traps, as well as capitalizing on casual turtle encounters when collecting other forest products. Turtles, of any species, are collected whenever and wherever encountered in the region, regardless of legal protection status or location inside protected areas. Collected turtles are traded, mostly illegally, through a network of local middlemen before being exported or consumed locally. Increasing economic value has ensured that hunting pressure is sustained despite the increasing rarity of the species (Hendrie 2000; Stuart and Timmins 2000; McCormack <em>et al</em>. 2010). Habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but more localized threat to the species (Stuart and Timmins 2000; Hendrie 2000).","Wang <em>et al</em>. (2011) calculated a population density of 0.7862 <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> per sq. km at Diaoluoshan Nature Reserve in Hainan, based on surveying six sampling areas with 424 baited traps over 6,360 trap-days. Elsewhere for <em>C. galbinifrons</em>, only anecdotal relative population density data are available. All recent indications are that the species requires extensive search effort to encounter. During field surveys in Lao PDR in 1993–1999, encounter rates were at the order of one turtle per three months in the field for a herpetologist, and one <em>C. galbinifrons</em> per day when working with a trained turtle hunting dog in prime turtle habitat (Stuart and Timmins 2000). A great deal of survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009–2012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for <em>C. galbinifrons.</em> Anecdotal information from interviews throughout the range inferred that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while the species was common 7–15 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. Corresponding increases in wholesale prices paid have been documented during interviews throughout the species range in Viet Nam (McCormack, unpubl. data). Whereas <em>C. galbinifrons</em> was observed in substantial quantities in illegal trade shipments in the 1990s and early 2000s, only sporadic animals are observed in recent years, even though hunter interviews indicate that collection effort has not decreased, but the encounter rate has dropped precipitously. The conclusion that remaining populations have declined steeply (estimated over 90%) is reasonable.",Decreasing,"<em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> is confirmed to occur in Hainan and Guangxi in PR China, in northeastern Lao PDR, and in northern Viet Nam at least as far south as Nghe An province (Iverson 1992; de Bruin and Artner 1999; Stuart <em>et al</em>.&#160;2002; Stuart and Parham 2004; Stuart and Platt 2004; Fritz and Havas 2007; Shi <em>et al</em>. 2008a; Wang <em>et al</em>. 2011; Blanck 2013; Som and Cottet 2016).","Historically <em>Cuora galbinifrons </em>has been consumed locally for food as part of a subsistence diet; however, in the last decade consumption has largely ceased with most animals now sold into the trade due to the high economic incentive. These turtles are readily collected with the assistance of hunting dogs, but difficult to find without them (Stuart and Timmins 2000). Juvenile animals are often kept at the village level in attempts to raise them to sell on into the trade (often unsuccessful, with animals dying). The species does not have specific local medicinal uses,<em> </em>but bones are often sold to traders for production of bone glue. In some areas turtles of all species are consumed as broad “health invigorators”. The <em>C. galbinifrons</em> group represents the second most valuable type of turtle in trade in Viet Nam and Lao PDR after the <em>C. trifasciata</em> complex.&#160;The UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database records a total of 2377 live specimens and 17 specimens as net and gross exports during the period 1998–2014.&#160;Visible trade in <em>C. galbininfrons</em> at Hanoi’s principal wildlife market, Don Xuan, stopped by about 2006 due to better market enforcement. Prior to this, dozens of <em>C. galbinifrons </em>were regularly available each week, these were often juvenile animals and intended for the pet market, not food. It is believed that most <em>C. galbinifrons </em>traded in Viet Nam<em> </em>are exported to Chinese markets. <span class=""longtext"">The species was present in nearly every reported market survey that looked at turtle trade in China and Hong Kong since recording began in 1993<em>. </em>All these animals appeared wild caught and most were offered alive in the food markets (Lau <em>et al</em>. 1995; Artner and Hofer 2001; Wang <em>et al</em>. 2004; Gong <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006, 2009; Cheung and Dudgeon 2006; Wu 2007). Cheung and Dudgeon recorded over 15,000 <em>C. galbinifrons</em> traded in Hong Kong markets alone during the period 2000–2003, making it the fourth most traded turtle species at 4% of total; <span class=""longtext"">comparing this to the total of 73 live <em>C. galbinifrons</em> that were recorded in the CITES trade database as exported during this same period worldwide (see above) suggests the scale of illegal and unrecorded trade. The volume of <em>C. galbinifrons</em> in visible trade continues to be highly significant in recent years; market surveys by Wildlife Conservation Society during 2008–2011 in Guangzhou, China, documented 1826 animals observed in food markets, and another 1944 animals recorded in the local pet trade (S. Roberton, in litt. to Viet Nam CITES Management Authority). Although legally protected in Lao PDR, trade continues almost unabated due to the porous border with Viet Nam and limited resources and capacity of law enforcement personnel (Stuart et al., 2011).&#160;Of particular significance is that commercial turtle farms in East Asia create a specific demand for animals collected from the wild, being considered the primary purchasers of wild-collected turtles and driving the collection of the last remaining wild animals through increased trade prices (Shi <em>et al</em>. 2007).&#160;IUCN and TRAFFIC noted that reported seizures involving <em>C. galbinifrons</em> provide evidence of illegal activities involving this species, although it is unclear whether any/all of these shipments were destined for international markets. In 1998, Vietnamese authorities reported having seized an estimated 700 (800 kg) of turtles and tortoises of 13 species, of which a small number were <em>C. galbinifrons</em>, from a public bus destined for Hanoi. The trader claimed that the animals were raised on farms in southern Viet Nam, but information provided to the authorities suggested they were collected from the wild in Viet Nam, Lao PDR, and possibly Cambodia. The cargo was for possible onward shipment to the Chinese market. In 1999, an estimated 150 <em>C. galbinifrons </em>were among specimens seized from a truck travelling from Central Viet Nam to Hanoi, which, at the time, was the largest number of specimens of this species observed in a single trade seizure (Hendrie 1999). In 2004, 277 kg of turtles were seized en route to Vinh City, Viet Nam, of which an unknown number were <em>C. galbinifrons</em>; police suspected that the turtles came across the border from Lao PDR.</span>",Terrestrial,"<p><em><span lang=""EN-GB"">Cuora galbinifrons</em>&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">was included in CITES Appendix II&#160;on 19 July 2000.

It appears that <em>C. elegans</em> has disappeared from several, if not most, of the major river systems that the species is historically known to have inhabited. The species has possibly disappeared completely from western Africa, with the greatest likelihood of a (likely depleted) population surviving in the middle Nile of Sudan and South Sudan. Overall, assuming a generation time of 25 years, the species has likely declined by over 80% over the past two generations, and the fishing and collecting pressures that depleted this large riverine species are likely to continue and possibly become more intensive. Thus the species qualifies as Critically Endangered under criteria A2bcd and A4bcd. <em>Cyclanorbis elegans</em> was last assessed in 1996, as Near Threatened.<br/></p>","<p>While no reliable habitat information is available for <em>C. elegans</em>, it is generally understood that this is a species that inhabits large rivers with muddy substrates (Gramentz 2008, Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). For instance, a single individual was captured some years ago in the River Niger, not far from Lokoja (Akani, Luiselli, Eniang, unpubl. data). No specific information is available on its diet (Gramentz 2008). The largest recorded animal, a male, was 67.6 cm straight carapace length (SCL) and weighed 20.4 kg; the largest recorded female was 51.6 cm SCL and 11.3 kg (McCord, in Gramentz 2008). Animals may reach perhaps up to 70 cm SCL (Gramentz 2008, Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012). No information on age or size at maturity, reproductive output, or longevity appear available; by analogy with other large riverine softshell turtle species, a generation time of 25 years is estimated.<br/></p>","Available information (Gramentz 2008, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015) indicates that collection of <em>C. elegans</em> for local consumption occurs and may be widespread and intensive if any significant populations remain anywhere, as the animals are large and their meat is highly esteemed. Old historic records exist from the Lake Volta area before the river was dammed to create the lake; the species may have been impacted by conversion of rivers to reservoirs in Ghana and elsewhere (Sub-Saharan WS, 2013).<br/><br/>Riverine turtles, like <em>C. elegans</em>, face similar pressures of extensive habitat destruction by sand mining, damming, channelization, and pollution (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). While the habitat of <em>C. elegans</em> has been mostly untouched by industrial development, planned hydrologic interventions upstream from the Sudd wetlands of South Sudan could have drastic consequences for <em>C. elegans</em> and other species that rely on the natural function of this flood-pulse ecosystem.","<em>Cyclanorbis elegans</em> is considered very rare in West Africa (Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Its distribution is fragmented and no detailed population data are available (Gramentz 2008, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Recent inquiries into the distribution and status of the species (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015) suggest that the species has become extremely rare across most of its range, with the possible exception of the middle Nile in South Sudan and Sudan. It is exceedingly rare in Nigeria, where it has a very narrow distribution, apparently concentrated around Lokoja (Akani, Luiselli, Eniang, unpubl. data). In Togo, it is also extremely rare: only a few museum specimens are known. The species is known to occur at Sansanné-Mango, Togo, along the Oti River (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014). A few specimens are known from Central African Republic, possibly surviving in the Ouam valley (Sub-Saharan WS 2013).<br/><br/>Very few observations have been recorded in recent decades from anywhere in its range; generally it is not known by fishermen, therefore it is likely to have disappeared long ago. In the Nile of South Sudan, interviewed fishermen knew about it, but no evidence of recent specimens could be found (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Studies on its distribution have been ongoing in Nigeria (by L. Luiselli, G.C. Akani, E.A. Eniang, N. Ebere, F. Petrozzi) and in Togo (L. Luiselli, F. Petrozzi, G.H. Segniagbeto); preliminary data confirm that the species is very rare, and possibly on the brink of extinction in these countries.",Decreasing,"<p><em>Cyclanorbis elegans</em> is known from localized disjunct occurrences in Ghana and northern Togo, in central Nigeria, the Niger river, southern Chad, northern Central African Republic, and the White Nile basin (including the Sobat) of South Sudan and Sudan (Iverson 1992, Gramentz 2008, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Occurrence in headwaters or intervening countries, such as in Benin or Ethiopia, is plausible but remains unconfirmed. A historic record exists from Lake Volta, before the river was dammed. Chirio and Ineich (2006) regarded the record of <em>C. elegans</em> by Joger (1990) in Central African Republic as potentially misidentified <em>C. senegalensis</em>, but occurrence in the Ouam valley is possible (Sub-Saharan WS, 2013). Gramentz (2008) questioned the record(s) from Cameroon (Chirio and LeBreton 2007), but photos of a specimen collected there by Chirio and LeBreton (2007) confirm the species' occurrence in Cameroon (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/></p>","<p>Human consumption of large softshell turtles is widespread and poses a serious threat to <em>C. elegans</em> (Gramentz 2008, Luiselli 2009, Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Bari fishermen in South Sudan consume the flesh of both <em>Cyclanorbis</em> species, including the cartilaginous portions of the shell. About half of the museum specimens utilized in a description of skeletal morphology had been harvested and butchered. In South Sudan, turtle eggs are opportunistically collected by pastoralists who bring their cattle to feed on the “toic” grasslands that form when the floodwaters of the Nile recede (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Eggs of large softshells (e.g., <em>Trionyx triunguis</em>) are consumed in southern Nigeria (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data); it is likely that the same applies to any remaining Nigerian populations of <em>C. elegans</em>.

This qualifies the species for Endangered (EN A3d). <em>Cycloderma frenatum</em> was last assessed in 1996, as Near Threatened.<br/></p>","Habitat usage by <em>Cycloderma frenatum</em> is poorly known; adults have been recorded mainly from large rivers and lakes, while hatchlings apparently inhabit floodplain marshes. In Gorongosa National Park some large individuals apparently undertake seasonal migrations from the permanent Lake Urema to temporarily flooded areas, which are many kilometers from the lake (P. Naskrecki, pers. comm). Areas with sandy rather than muddy substrates appear to be preferred (Gramentz 2008, Broadley and Sachsse 2011). <em>Cycloderma frenatum</em> ranges from 500 m altitude in Lake Malawi to just above sea level.<br/><br/>Available information suggests that <em>C. frenatum</em> feeds mainly on clams and snails; other food like fish, aquatic insects, crustaceans and amphibians may be consumed on occasion (review by Gramentz 2008). Maximum size is unknown; few recorded animals exceed 56 cm straight carapace length (CL), but there are indications animals may get substantially larger. Reported maximum weight correspondingly varies from 13-14 to 18 kg (reviews by Gramentz 2008, and Broadley and Sachsse 2011). No information has been reported on growth rates, age or size at maturity, longevity, or generation time; by analogy with other large softshelled turtles, a generation time of 15 to 20 years may be assumed for this molluscivore species of permanent waterbodies. Adult females produce clutches of 15-25 eggs, and available data indicate that multiple clutches per year are likely. Hatchlings measure 40-48 mm SCL and weigh about 15 g (Gramentz 2008, Broadley and Sachsse 2011).","While eggs and animals of <em>Cycloderma frenatum</em> are known to be subject to collection and local consumption, the impact of this on populations remains largely unknown. Likewise the impact of collection for international trade, especially in the area of Lake Malawi, destined primarily for the East Asian consumption and medicinal trade, remains unquantified, but is potentially severe (by analogy of such impacts on Asian and North American softshell turtle populations). The species has also been observed in the pet trade in Hong Kong (Cheung and Dudgeon 2006). Water pollution has additionally been suggested as a potential impact on the species (Gramentz 2008).<br/><br/>Crocodiles still survive in many of the rivers where the species occurs, but their diet has probably shifted as normal food resources have declined. Large and middle-sized mammals, waterfowl and large fish are all reduced in these areas due to human exploitation; crocodiles may therefore have shifted their prey in part to large flapshell turtles. Recent exploitation and sales of flapshell turtles are probably resulting from the massive influx of Chinese construction workers and crews extracting hardwoods from the miomo and mopane forests in Mozambique. Timber and dried turtle shells appear to be shipped out in containers returning to China (W.R. Branch, in litt).","<p>No population information is available, other than anecdotal observations that the species was previously common in Lake Malawi and the upper Shire River (Mitchell 1946, cited by Gramentz 2008; Broadley and Sachsse 2011).&#160;In Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique the species is still frequently observed in Lake Urema and adjacent flooded regions.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Cycloderma frenatum</em> inhabits rivers and lakes in eastern Africa, from the Rufiji River basin in Tanzania in the north through Lake Malawi and the Rufiji, Rovuma, and Lower Zambezi river basins, extending south to the lower Save (Sabi) river of southeastern Zimbabwe and central Mozambique (Iverson 1992, Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Branch 2008, Gramentz 2008).

The species has been reported in the international pet trade (Cheung and Dudgeon 2006), but not in any great numbers. Reports have emerged in recent years, up through the present, of repeated occurrences of organized and illegal collection practices within the Lake Malawi biosphere reserve, with large numbers of adults being caught, slaughtered, and processed locally in Mangochi for export of shells and dried meat to China and East Asia (P.P. van Dijk and A.G.J.

While generation time is not determined for the species, it is conservatively estimated at 15 years; considering trends over the past 30 years (two generations), and expected habitat loss and invasive impacts over the next 15 years, a 50% loss of suitable habitat and thus total adult populations is more than likely. Especially its dependence on a rare microhabitat of impenetrable soils and natural shallow depressions that allows rain water to collect in shallow ponds in combination with the high value of the same habitat to be altered for cattle-farming has increased the risk for <em>A. pallidipectoris </em>through microhabitat destruction. In addition, its low population numbers (and in many cases the historical age) of known occurrences, and small densities within the populations indicates an extremely small total population size, estimated at well below 2,500 mature animals, thus meeting criteria C1 and C2a(i).<br/><em><br/>Acanthochelys pallidipectoris </em>was last assessed in 1996, as VU A1c + D1. Since then, the situation of habitat destruction has changed dramatically. Paraguay (SEAM 2014) and Argentina (Prado 2012) list <em>A. pallidipectoris</em> as Endangered at the national level, which also was supported on the species level by the participants of the <span class=""datalabel"">IUCN Red Listing and Action Planning Workshop for Chelonians of the Southern Cone, Filadelfia, Paraguay, 15-19 April 2012, including the Bolivian representative. &#160;</p>","<p><em>Acanthochelys pallidipectoris</em> is a small freshwater turtle species that normally reaches carapace lengths of 12.8-16.2 cm (review by Vinke <em>et al</em>. 2011), with a maximum carapace length of 17.5 cm CL reported (female, holotype, Freiberg 1945). Females are a little larger and higher domed than males (Pazko and Hernando 2005). Fully-grown adults weigh about 400 g (Richard and Bertonatti, 1998). Hatchlings measure about 31 mm CL (Pazko and Hernando 2005, Métrailler 2008).<br/><br/>Reproduction is little-known in this species. Both males and females appear mature at about 13-14 cm CL and 325-400 g (Horne 1993). Mating occurs terrestrially during the short rainy season at the peak of the summer (Pazko and Hernando 2005, Gonzales&#160;<em>et al.</em>2006). Apparently a single clutch of 2-5 eggs is produced per year (Richard 1991, Horne 1993) in captive conditions, though it is likely that in the wild the species may only breed during optimal years. Age at maturity, longevity and generation length appear unknown for this species. Generation length is conservatively estimated at 15 years, by analogy with other small chelid turtle species inhabiting strongly seasonal arid habitats (e.g.&#160;<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>: &#160;Kuchling and Bradshaw, 1993).<br/><br/>The limitations of the arid habitat portions of the Chaco means that <em>A. pallidipectoris</em> only occurs in temporarily flooded lowlands of the dry shrub forest with impenetrable soils (clay) and river-bed-like depressions that provide shallow water collected during the infrequent but heavy summer rains (Pazko and Hernando 2005, Vinke <em>et al</em>. 2011; T. Vinke and S. Vinke pers. obs.). In Mendoza, Argentina, a non-native population of this species occurs in a network of small artificial lagoons and ponds (Richard 1999).<br/><br/>The active period is restricted to the rainy season (less than six months, sometimes only four months), between October and March. The animals hibernate during the cooler dry season, terrestrially under <em>Bromelia</em> spp. and <em>Aechma</em> in the Natural Park Chaco (Pazko and Hernando 2005).&#160;The species feeds on a variety of small aquatic prey, mainly insects but also spiders, tadpoles, fish, and small organisms from the water surface (Richard 1999).</p>","<p>The main threat to <em>A. pallidipectoris</em> is habitat degradation and loss. The Gran Chaco region and especially the more arid part, the Dry Chaco, is highly appreciated for cattle-farming (Paraguay, Bolivia) and soy bean culture (Argentina). In the last decade the deforestation rates of the arid Chaco have increased dramatically.&#160;The main areas of deforestation in Paraguay and Argentina match closely the distribution map of the species (compare <span lang=""EN-GB"">Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the main area of occurrence of <em>A. pallidipectoris</em> in Paraguay, the Department Boquerón, a portion of 1.9 million ha (21.7 % of the total surface) received permits to be cleared between 2003 and 2012, of which 78.6% (1.6 million ha and 17.0% of the total surface) had been permitted in the last six years (2007-2012) <span lang=""EN-GB"">(<span class=""A11"">Torres 2008, Barrios Kuck and Torres 2013)<span class=""A11"">. It is expected <span lang=""EN-GB"">that in the Paraguayan Chaco all suitable land (land <span class=""A11"">not located within the national protected area system, or reserved for indigenous communities, or held as private protected areas) will have been transformed for cattle production by 2025 (Yanosky 2013). <span lang=""EN-GB"">This trend is not any better in Argentina with an increase of the deforestation rate in the Chaco by 439% from 2011 to 2012 (43,717 to <span lang=""EN-GB"">235,601 ha), keeping nearly the high level also in 2013 (Vinke <em>et al.</em> 2011, Rodas <em>et al.</em> 2012, Palacios <em>et al.</em> 2013, Cardozo <em>et al. </em>2014)<span lang=""EN-GB"">.<br/><br/>In contrast to <em>Acanthochelys macrocephala,</em> which seems to be adapting to the altered landscape by opportunistically utilizing artificial cattle ponds (Vinke and Vinke 2001, 2008), this development is fatal for <em>A. pallidipectoris </em>due to its dependence of the above described microhabitat. For the cattle farmers the clay soil of those lowland depressions is of extreme high value and therefore this habitat type is widely destroyed by digging it out either directly as deep water reservoirs for cattle or by using the soil to build high tanks for the same function. Both of these destroy the habitat for <em>A. pallidipectoris.</em> The clay soil is also excavated for use in road building.<br/><br/>In Argentina the greatest threat is due to extensive habitat loss through intensive monocultures of soybean, especially in the provinces of <span lang=""EN-GB"">Chaco, Formosa, Santiago del Estero, northwestern Santa Fe and northeastern Salta. This monoculture leads to a serious risk regarding the stability of the complete Chaco ecosystem, and therefore to the populations of <em>A. pallidipectoris</em>, which only is found within the few isolated remains of the native Chaco vegetation. A survey of the region of the Chaco of the province Salta in 2009 showed the huge devastation (E. Richard pers. obs.; Vinke <em>et al</em>. 2011), leaving the native fauna without suitable habitat.<br/><br/>In addition in Paraguay, competition with <em>A. macrocephala</em> and <em>Caiman yacare</em>, which have both migrated into the dry Chaco following the habitat modification of cattle farming and cattle ponds, are apparent threats in places where more water is available (Vinke and Vinke 2008). Finally, data suggest that changing climate regimes causing drought and abnormally low temperatures in winter and extremely high temperatures in spring and summer are likely to become a threat in the future (i.e. the 2007 winter was the coldest on record in South America, and the drought in 2008-2009 lasted for 16 months in the Chaco (T.

Robust calculations are therefore impossible; however, we can attempt extrapolations based on the same type of reasoning as above, again using Nigeria as a benchmark. <br/> <br/>Assuming that: (i) the density of tortoises has remained constant in suitable habitats, (ii) local hunting pressure has remained constant over the years (this is very unlikely, given that the human population has grown from about 35 million in 1959 to approximately 120 million in 2001 (Anonymous 1960, Nigeria Population Census 2001), and (iii) the suitable habitat for <em>K. homeana</em> has declined by at least 90% in the last 40 years, then it can be estimated that in 1960 (date of Nigerian independence) there were at least 5,000,000 tortoises in Nigeria compared to the estimate of about 500,000 today. Hence, using these estimates (i.e., a 90% decline in suitable habitat in the past 40 years, translating to a decline of roughly 40% per 10 years), <em>K. homeana</em> can be classified as Vulnerable A2cd according to IUCN (2001) criteria. In particular, if we assume the generation time for this species to be about 15 years, then the three generations to be considered for Red Listing encompasses the entire 40 year period and thus a 90% decline. This would qualify as Critically Endangered under criteria A2cd. Again, this is for Nigeria, not range-wide, but there is no indication that Nigeria represents an exceptionally bad case of decline (apart from its high human population size), more a best-studied case and indicative for most of the region. Similar extrapolations can be performed for the other countries as well, and all these calculations conclude that (i) the population decline has been very rapid for <em>K. homeana</em>, and (ii) there is no reason to predict that this trend will be reversed or slowed. <br/> <br/>It is clear that <em>K. homeana</em> is currently experiencing a very serious decline over much of its range, due mainly to habitat loss and intensive harvesting for subsistence and traditional medicine (""ju-ju""), as well as for the international pet trade. It seems more than likely that these threats will continue to grow in the next five years, due to continuing rates of deforestation, overpopulation, and industrial development in some crucial areas (e.g., southern Nigeria). Therefore, it is warranted to change the Red List status of <em>K. homeana</em> from Data Deficient to Vulnerable. Concerted national and international conservation efforts are needed to save the species from further decline, and it is advised that these efforts must be based strictly on scientific criteria. Consultation with individual specialists and other relevant parties such as the IUCN SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group are encouraged at all times during the planning and implementation of conservation efforts.","Most of the data available on the habitat preferences of <em>K. homeana</em> populations are based on anecdotal observations and not on sound data. It is generally reported that this species occurs in forests all throughout its range, generally of a drier type than the forests inhabited by <em>K. erosa</em> (Ernst and Barbour 1989). According to Broadley (1989) it inhabits the lowland evergreen forest, and a similar habitat has been described in western Cameroon (Lawson 1993), where it is locally threatened by clearance of forest for cultivation (e.g., around Nfainchang; Lawson 1993).
<br/>
<br/>The most detailed study on the habitat preferences of <em>K. homeana</em> has been done in southern Nigeria. At a landscape scale, a statistical study (based on logistic regression of presence/absence data) revealed that Nigerian populations of <em>K. homeana</em> are habitat specialists, being linked to zones of secondary dry forest around mangroves and in zones with secondary swamp-forest (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000). Considering that in the Delta states these habitat types have declined dramatically during the last decades, falling from 2% of state area in 1976–78 to only 0.2% in 1993–95 (Geomatics 1996) due primarily to petrochemical expansion, it may be inferred that habitat loss represents a very serious reason of decline for these tortoises at a global scale. This supposition is reinforced by evidence that <em>K. homeana</em> needs closed forest canopy and shady microhabitats to avoid overheating, and shows behavioral thermoregulation in its avoidance of overheating (Luiselli 2005), i.e. allowing only short periods of exposure to the sun during movements between sunlit and shaded areas (Hailey and Coulson 1998, Luiselli 2005). Another potential limitation factor of habitat occupancy by <em>K. homeana</em> may be a potential for interspecific competition for food with the closely related <em>K. erosa</em>, which exhibits a wide overlap in terms of spatial use (Luiselli 2003b).
<br/>
<br/>At a local scale, Luiselli (2003a) demonstrated that the type of attitude of human communities towards tortoises may have very serious consequences on the habitat preferences of these animals, so that any generalization can be difficult. Luiselli (2003a) studied tortoise population ecology at six study areas with similar habitat characteristics in the eastern axis of the Niger Delta. In three areas, the tortoises had been worshipped by local communities for a long time as holy animals, whereas in three other areas they were actively hunted for subsistence. The habitat use by tortoises varied depending on the type of treatment by the indigenous people (hunting vs. veneration): in the veneration areas the tortoises were frequently found in disparate habitats (i.e., dense dry bush, sparse dry bush, riparian vegetation, swamps, and plantations; Luiselli 2003a). In the hunting areas the tortoises were found almost exclusively inside dense bush, and always avoided plantations. It seems likely that the different habitat usage reflects extirpation from easier hunting areas (Luiselli 2003a). This study may have important global consequences for this species' status, because it demonstrates that wherever they are hunted for subsistence (which is a common occurrence in West and Central Africa, e.g., see Fa <em>et al</em>. 2000, Lawson 2000, Fa and Garcia Juste 2001, Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2003), the habitat in which they are still found is just a fraction of the potential habitat. They are limited to forest patches with very dense vegetation where access for human hunters is difficult. Forest habitat loss is an enormous problem in West Africa because of the rate of destruction (Oates 1999), and concomitant with this, human overpopulation and increasing hunting pressure (e.g., Luiselli 2003a,c; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2003) means that the long-term viability of these tortoises is at high risk.
<br/>
<br/>Clearance of forest for cultivation is also considered a cause of decline for <em>K. homeana</em> in Cameroon (e.g., around Nfainchang; Lawson 1993). Although we do not have quantitative data for other countries it is obvious that the same is happening almost everywhere in the range of this tortoise, since in all these countries human population density is growing, forest loss is rapid, and hunting for subsistence is rampant (e.g., see discussion in Oates 1999).","<em>K. homeana</em> is currently experiencing a very serious decline in much of its range, due mainly to habitat loss (through agricultural and industrial expansion and deforestation) and intensive harvesting for subsistence and traditional medicine (""ju-ju"") by local people in desperately poor economic condition, as well as for the international pet trade (further details on all these threats are given above). <br/> <br/>Although <em>K. homeana</em> is still found in nearly all the forest-zone protected areas in Nigeria (see Table 4 in the Supplementary Material) and in Cameroon (Lawson 2000), there is no doubt that hunting is still rampant in all these protected areas, as testified by harvest data provided by Lawson (2000) and the observations of Luiselli (2003c) of hunted specimens inside two protected areas in the Niger Delta. Hence, a crucial point to be addressed by future studies is the impact that illegal hunting activities may have on populations of <em>K. homeana</em> inside formally established protected areas. At present, it is clear that protected area populations are not free of exploitation.","There are no available data on the global population size and density of <em>K. homeana</em> at the continental scale. We therefore need to use the few data available on the density and home ranges of these tortoises from some specific localities to generate estimates of population size at the continental scale.
<br/>
<br/>In the Niger Delta (southern Nigeria), during 1995–2002, we radiotracked 33 adults (20 males and 13 females) for 40 continuous days, and measured mean home range size (quantified via minimum convex polygon) of 0.37 km² for males and 0.24 km² for females, with some specimens (especially males) exhibiting home ranges as large as 0.46 km². Lawson (2000) also stated that, in western Cameroon, male home range may exceed 0.5 km²; his data are very similar to our own despite the different study regions and environmental conditions. Moreover, both in Nigeria (Luiselli and associates unpublished data) and in Cameroon (Lawson 2000), male tortoises are highly territorial, and usually drive other males away from their core home ranges. Thus, the density of these tortoises is low in most places even in highly suitable environments. Luiselli (2003a) presented some data on population structure and abundance of <em>K. homeana</em> that can be useful for calculating a rough density of these tortoises under natural conditions. During 20 consecutive field days of research in southern Nigeria (10 days in the wet season and 10 days in the dry season, from February 2001 to January 2002) ten people independently searching a 20 ha area found an average density of 1.4 tortoises/ha at six localities. The density ranged from 0.15 to 0.9 tortoises/ha in harvest areas, and from 1.65 to 2.85 tortoises/ha in veneration areas (density values calculated from Table 1 in Luiselli, 2003a).
<br/>
<br/><em>K. homeana</em> is known to inhabit similar habitats across its entire range, and data from separate regions (Cameroon and Nigeria) showed a clear similarity also in home range size and territoriality. Hence we may use the above population density of approximately 1.4 individuals/ha for <em>K. homeana</em> in Nigeria to extrapolate estimates for the whole species range. Calculating population size from the population density estimates (Luiselli 2003a), we expect approximately 140 tortoises in an area of 1 km², which would give a figure of about 1,300,900 tortoises in all of Nigeria according to the most optimistic view (i.e., assuming that in 50% of the occupied sites there is veneration, and no hunting pressure). However, since our data show that veneration occurs in less than 1% of the occupied sites, the total tortoise population figure would be much lower. With an average density (calculated from Luiselli 2003a for harvest areas) of 0.53 individuals/ha this gives 53.33 tortoises/km², and about 500,000 tortoises in all of Nigeria. This latter figure is probably a much more accurate population estimate. If we apply the above reasoning to the whole of this species’ range we calculate a total population size for <em>K. homeana</em> of at best 4,205,000 tortoises.
<br/>
<br/>Lawson (2000), studying the harvest rates of <em>K. homeana</em> in three protected areas of Cameroon (Korup National Park, Banyang-Mbo Sanctuary, and Nta-Ali Reserve), estimated an overall mean annual harvest rate of 0.3 animals/km² in these areas with good habitat conditions and relatively low human density. Then, if 100% of the species’ range was protected and under relatively low human density, and extrapolating harvest data by Lawson (2000), the expected annual harvest rate would have been 236,532 tortoises, i.e., 5.6% of the total surviving tortoise population. However, the percent of protected territory is less than 3% of the species’ range, and the human population density is much higher in several regions of the species’ range than in the three protected areas of Cameroon studied by Lawson (2000), and hence we may conclude that the annual harvest rate is certainly much higher than the calculated 5.6%, but not quantifiable on the basis of current data. Also acknowledging the theoretical limits of our calculations, which are simply estimates, it is still very likely that the free-ranging populations of this species cannot sustain the current pressure (combination of continuing habitat loss and hunting) for more than 2–3 generations (<em>sensu</em> IUCN 2001), with each generation being about 15 years. Based on the above assumption, <em>K. homeana</em> meets at least the IUCN Red List criteria for Vulnerable status, but a case for an even higher category of risk can be made.",Decreasing,"<strong>Historical Distribution Data</strong> <br/> <br/><em>K. homeana</em> is a forest tortoise with considerable range over the continuous Guinea-Congo rainforest region. The most reliable account of its distribution is provided by Iverson (1992), although comments are available also in later literature (e.g., Vetter 2002). However, it should be taken into account that for this species as well as for many Afrotropical reptiles, the picture of the distribution is based on an indiscriminate list of all the reliable locality records collected also during the colonial age (i.e., often in areas which have been drastically modified by humans during the last decades). As a result, these maps are often little more than ""ideal maps"", a reflection of a species’ previous distribution rather than its current status. Because of this, the distribution map of <em>K. homeana</em> (and virtually of all other medium to large size vertebrates) is a great overestimation of its real distribution. <br/>  <br/><em>K. homeana</em> is found in Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, and in the Democratic Republic of Congo (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material). <br/> <br/><u>Liberia</u> - was found throughout the whole country: known in the north-west provinces as well as in the extreme southeast, around Harper (Iverson 1992).  <br/><u>Cote d'Ivoire</u> - Recorded in the forests around Aboisso in the south (Iverson 1992).  <br/><u>Ghana</u> - Reported to be widespread in the southern territories (Iverson 1992).  <br/><u>Togo</u> - No localities are presented in Iverson (1992), but see under Present Range below.  <br/><u>Benin</u> - No localities are presented in Iverson (1992), but see below. <br/><u>Nigeria</u> - Found only in the southern regions (Iverson 1992), in the continuous rainforest vegetation zone.  <br/><u>Cameroon</u> - Found throughout the coastal regions and also in the Southern Province (Iverson 1992); its presence has also been well documented in the Southwest Province in recent years (e.g., Lawson 1993, 2000, 2001).  <br/><u>Equatorial Guinea</u> - Found both on Bioko Island and in Rio Muni (Iverson 1992). <br/><u>Gabo</u> – Not recorded by Iverson (1992), but likely present because of a very few specimens exported in recent years to international markets. <br/><u>The Democratic Republic of Congo</u> - Isolated subpopulations are known from the easternmost forests, close to the political borders with southern Sudan and western Uganda (Iverson 1992). These subpopulations should be accurately studied to understand if they are an isolated subspecies or typical <em>homeana</em>.  <br/> <br/><strong>Present Range</strong> <br/> <br/><u>Liberia</u> - No recent survey on the distribution of this species in Liberia has been published. Several specimens (&gt;50) were found by our research staff in the bush-meat markets of Monrovia, Buchanan, and Gbarnga during July 2000. According to the sellers, the tortoises were captured in the nearby surroundings. We also captured (and marked) 14 specimens in the coastal forest around Greenville, in July 2002, during a period of 8 consecutive days of research (a total of 68 hours spent in the field). <em>K. homeana</em> is reported by villagers to be locally common (e.g., around Gbarnga), and the pilot surveys in Greenville established an average sighting frequency of 1.75 tortoises/day, which is intermediate between those observed in southern Nigeria in (i) a harvest area (0.84 tortoises/day) and (ii) a non-harvest area (2.98 tortoises/day) (Luiselli 2003a). Based on interviews with local hunters and on our preliminary data, we believe that <em>K. homeana</em> is still widespread in Liberia, although likely declining due to over-exploitation by people. In particular, the civil war which has raged throughout Liberia in recent years has had serious consequences for several populations of this species. <em>K. homeana</em> became a common food item for people displaced into forests or bushlands to escape the fighting. Indeed, several interviewees confirmed that tortoises were one of the main protein sources not only for people escaping war but also for soldiers operating in forested zones. <br/><u>Cote d'Ivoire</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. Historical records (summarized in Iverson 1992) showed that it is found only in the south. <br/><u>Ghana</u> – <em>K. homeana</em> has been found recently in Onyadze and Ony-Winn (two sites of Muni-Pomadze Lagoon, southern Ghana) in secondary forest and grass/thicket habitats (Raxworthy and Attuquayefio 2000). Our staff did not capture any free-ranging specimen of this species during some pilot surveys conducted in the years 1995, 1996, and 1998 in the coastal bushland in the Great Accra region, but we did capture a single male in a bush-plantation area around Cape Coast (southwestern Ghana). Additional surveys in October–November 2003 in the markets around Accra and Koforidua (southern Ghana) indicated several specimens traded, and a very few specimens found in the field (which would likely mean a very low population density; see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). Based on data provided by Raxworthy and Attuquayefio (2000), plus our surveys (and from comparisons with other geographic regions like Liberia and Nigeria), and on interviews with local people, we consider this species to have become increasingly uncommon in Ghana. The numbers of free-ranging tortoises captured for the international pet trade should also be monitored, because it cannot be excluded that, as in Togo (Harris 2001), several traded specimens do not come from tortoise farms. <br/><u>Togo</u> - Found only in the remnant forests around the towns of Kpalime and Badou (southwestern Togo) (Harris 2001).  <br/><u>Benin</u> – Although no records are available in Iverson (1992), the species is certainly present in Benin Republic, where it is heavily exploited and also exported to western countries (see Figure 1, and Tables 1 and 2 in the Supplementary Material). <br/><u>Nigeria</u> - The current distribution is well known because the species has been studied intensively by ourselves and associates during the last ten years (e.g., Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2003; Luiselli 2003a,b,c, 2005). This species has been observed by our staff in several States:  <br/>Lagos -- presumably rare; several specimens were only found in the forest fragments and bush around Maryland, and around Lekki Lagoon. <br/>Oyo -- presumably declining (according to several interviewees); we found it in the forest patches around Ibadan, where it has been collected also in the past (Blackwell 1968), and is actively hunted (Butler and Shitu 1985). <br/>Edo -- locally common in mature forest fragments, but presumably extirpated from the many recently deforested areas. Based on random surveys throughout 13 potential sites of occurrence in 1999–2000, we verified its presence in only 4 sites (30.8%). <br/>Delta -- very endangered due to severe habitat loss (potential habitat for tortoises covers approximately 0.1% of the state area) and hunting for subsistence. For instance, it was found along the riverine swamp-forests of the Etiope River in 1982, but not found again in 2001 (Lea <em>et al</em>. 2003).  <br/>Bayelsa and Rivers -- found in some swamp-forest patches of both these states (e.g., Powell 1993, Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000) and is locally common in a few areas where it is worshipped by indigenous communities (Luiselli 2003a). However it is actively persecuted for both subsistence and traditional medicine (""ju-ju"") in most areas, where it is very likely to be declining (see data in Luiselli 2003a). In addition, it is severely threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) due to expanding petrochemical development.  <br/>Anambra -- extremely rare, it is found only in a few riverine forest patches in the southernmost part of this state and surrounding Oguta (in AGIP oilfield forest site). Most of the state landscape is characterized by plantations and cultivations, not suitable habitat for this tortoise. <br/>Akwa-Ibom -- severely fragmented populations are found in a few riverine forests (e.g., along the banks of the River Kwa-Ibo) and in the Stubbs Creek Forest Reserve; many specimens are traded for ""ju-ju"" and food in Uyo market, but it seems that a good proportion of them may have come from the adjacent Cross River State (Eniang unpublished data). In addition, it is severely threatened by habitat loss (deforestation) due to petrochemical expansion in coastal areas. More common at the border with Cross River State (surroundings of Itu). <br/>Cross River -- common in lowland forests (e.g., in the Ikpan Forest block, see Eniang and Luiselli 2002), it is replaced by <em>Kinixys erosa</em> in hilly and mountainous forests. In the Cross River National Park, for instance, it is much less common than <em>K. erosa</em>, but this is probably due to natural ecological constraints. <br/><u>Cameroon</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. Lawson (2000) reported a very strong hunting pressure on this species in the Western and South-West Provinces. Lawson (1993) recorded its presence in 7 different sites (Abat, Mundemba, Baro, Besingi, Ekundu Kundu, Pamol Palm Plantations, Nfainchang). Additional known localities are Bipindi, Dibongo, Jengwe, Kribi, Déhané, Nkolembembe, Nko’olong, and Akom II (van Dijk 1994, LeBreton 1999). <br/><u>Equatorial Guinea</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. <br/><u>Gabon</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. Its distribution is unknown but likely extremely reduced (for instance it has not found during two very extensive field surveys in the ‘Monts de Cristal’, and in the ‘Massif du Chaillu’; see Pauwels <em>et al</em>. 2002a,b), although very few specimens were traded and exported (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). <br/><u>The Democratic Republic of Congo</u> - No recent surveys made by ourselves or associates. <br/> <br/><strong>Extent of Occurrence</strong> <br/>According to our calculations, based on maps in Iverson (1992) modified by data reported in other sources published before 1992, and on original data made available to us (referring to distributions in 1980–90), the entire range of <em>K. homeana</em> had a potential extent of occurrence of about 788,843 km² in 1992 (see Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). The country comprising the highest percentage of the potential range was Nigeria (23.4% ), followed by Cameroon (20.3%). <br/> <br/>Because Nigeria and Cameroon comprise the greatest proportion of this species’ potential range (43.7%) they are appropriate to assess the current global status of <em>K. homeana</em> in the absence of firm data from the other countries. <br/> <br/><strong>Area of Occupancy</strong> <br/>Because few fieldwork-based data on the area of occupancy exist for <em>K. homeana</em>, the area of occupancy is simply defined as 10% of the area of extent of occurrence as applied in the Red List Criteria (IUCN 2001), yielding an estimate of 78,843 km². In Nigeria, where the human population density is expanding rapidly (currently about 120 million people) and where the remnant proportion of forests is very low (about 1% of that found in the 1950s; Geomatics 1996), it is almost certain that the current tortoise range is far less than the 10% of former range expected according to IUCN (2001) criteria. We would suggest that a more appropriate estimate of the current range of <em>K. homeana</em> in Nigeria is approximately 5% of that in 1992 (i.e., approximately 9,235 km², and this is certainly an overestimation). A current occupation of only 5% of the 1992 range would translate to an assessment, for the Nigerian populations, as Critically Endangered under criteria A2c. Of course this does not include reduction in occupancy in other range states, and so we could not be sure about the soundness of any generalization of this assessment as CR. However, it has not been reported anywhere that the species survives significantly better in other countries, and there is little cause for optimism. Hence, based on these calculations, the status of <em>K. homeana</em> is clearly becoming vulnerable due to the considerable extent of habitat loss in addition to subsistence hunting.",,Terrestrial,"1). It is important to plan the management of this species by collecting as much information as possible on the cultural interactions between local human communities and tortoises, because it may be possible to create a mosaic of protected areas linking all the forested zones in which people traditionally worship tortoises. This strategy is certainly possible in some areas of southern Nigeria (Bayelsa State), e.g., around the towns of Sagbama and Brass.  <br/> <br/>2). Although <em>K. homeana</em> is on CITES Appendix II, thus banning the import of wild individuals into Europe (EC regulation number 338/97), it nevertheless seems necessary to develop further conservation legislation in favor of this species both at the international and national levels. At the national and sub-national level it is necessary to include this species among the protected fauna in all the countries of occurrence. At present, there is virtually no country that can reliably preserve this species, and we have seen several specimens traded for food or traditional medicine even inside protected areas (e.g., Upper Orashi Forest Reserve in Rivers State, southeastern Nigeria). Another serious problem is represented by the high rates of export of these tortoises to western markets from such countries as Ghana and Togo (e.g., see Lawson 2000). The exports of these specimens should be seriously controlled to prevent free-ranging specimens being taken, especially considering that it is often unclear how these specimens are obtained because tortoise farms are very underdeveloped in these countries. Harris (2001), for instance, found that most <em>Python regius</em> exported from Togo to Europe were claimed to come from farms but were actually newborns of wild-caught females (who were killed after oviposition). Close control should be exercised on these farms to prevent the tortoise trade from being conducted in the same way.  <br/> <br/>3). The field ecology of <em>K. homeana</em> has been studied intensively only in southern Nigeria and in western Cameroon. These studies should be continued in these two countries to achieve a very detailed dataset, but should also be urgently expanded into other countries of this species’ range for comparative purposes. The same is true also for the studies on the relationship between humans and tortoises. <br/> <br/>4). There is a strong need to establish protected areas that include populations of these tortoises, and perhaps a very promising initiative would be to create protected corridors by linking areas where local people traditionally protect tortoises.  <br/> <br/>5). Potential attempts at trade management have been undertaken (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). However, these should be developed more to reduce impact of export trade on wild-caught animals.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
3292503,11534,Lepidochelys olivacea,Vulnerable,A2bd,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Assessment procedure</span><br/>In accordance with the IUCN guidelines for Red List Assessments, the focus of this evaluation has been the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001). For Olive Ridleys, as with other sea turtle species, as it is not possible to survey mature individuals we used an index of abundance in the form of the number of annual nesting females. Although not all females breed every year (see section on Reproduction below) and males are not evaluated, this index is considered to be the most reliable estimator for long-term population trends of marine turtles since the proportion of the total number of females that nest in any given year and the sex ratio is believed to be fairly constant across time within and between subpopulations (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996).<br/><br/>Direct counts of the number of nesting females (NF) are not always available so we also relied on alternative information that can be converted to NF: number of nests per season, nests/km/yr or number of protected nests per season; annual estimates of hatchling or egg production, or census estimates of nesting females from arribada rookeries. When these proxies were used, the counted units were converted to NF based on the following constants: 105 eggs/nest and 2.5 nests/season/female. Some conservation programs reported annual number of protected nests but did not include the quantity of poached or otherwise destroyed or predated nests. For these cases we extrapolated to the total number of nests based on local estimates of conservation efficiency. All conversions to NF were made under the assumptions that (a) the mean number of eggs/nest and the number of nests/female/season do not differ significantly over the timescales we have used; and (b) the effort and the coverage of the biological parameters we used are reasonably constant through the time frame evaluated. In cases where the different surveys involved different levels of coverage, explicit corrections were made and specified in the result tables.<br/><br/>In spite of the Olive Ridley being the most abundant sea turtle, available quantitative information is extremely scarce and unevenly distributed across regions. We thus relied on a subset of the world’s rookeries which, we assume, exhibit population trends that are representative of the population as a whole or, at least, for each of the regions. We selected 28 Index Sites (see Figure 1 and Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below) for which reasonably long time series of quantitative data are available. They include all the largest known populations, as well as an assortment of smaller rookeries from almost all of the regions where the species is found. All sites are assumed to be demographically independent. However, although genetic data indicate a high degree of inter-rookery migration between some rookeries (e.g., Brazil-Suriname- Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (1998); between México to Central America in the Eastern Pacific- Briseño-Dueñas (1998)) the results reflect events within an evolutionary timescale (many generations). Within the time span relevant to the assessment (two to three generations), available evidence suggests significant demographic independence between the pairs of rookeries in question (e.g., mark-recapture in Nancite and Ostional indicate the vast majority are different turtles- reviewed by Bernardo and Plotkin (2007); absence of exchange by tagged turtles and non-overlapping nesting seasons Brazil vs Suriname/French Guiana- de Silva et al. (in press); and the lack of re-colonization of depleted arribadas in Jalisco and Guerrero in México by the very large Escobilla rookery, 500 to 1,000 km distant in over four decades).<br/><br/>The population abundance estimates were based on raw data or on extrapolations from regressions performed on available data. As the relatively data-rich trends consistently indicated exponential trajectories we relied on these as the method of choice for extrapolations. Some data sets contained a number of trajectories across the time frames employed and in these more than one regression was employed or a combination of regressions and raw data. We have constrained our back extrapolations to time spans close to known historical events that are believed to have defined major abundance changes in order to avoid gross exaggerations with no supporting evidence. This has, however, meant that in some cases the extrapolations have only been performed back two generations (40 years) and could be considered underestimates of decline.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the assessment process</span><br/>Calculations based on very different datasets obtained by different workgroups, using multiple survey methods and spanning many decades are fraught with uncertainties. A number of these could be biasing our assessment. (1) Combining abundance information for individual rookeries obtained with a number of different methodologies could provide a source of error. However, we believe that the magnitude of these errors is of minor significance to the final declines estimated. (2) Because of the assessment’s requirement for quantitative information, a very small proportion of the total known rookeries were included, and some regions are not well represented. The bias this introduces is further augmented since it is most likely that rookeries having long time series of data are also the most monitored and hence the better protected. In this case the estimates of decline will be underestimated relative to the true trends for the more numerous and less well monitored/protected rookeries. This is likely the case for regions with little (Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean) or no (entire Eastern Atlantic) representation in our assessment that contribute very little to our global decline values yet where reports with qualitative evidence indicate extensive population declines (reviewed by Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Nonetheless, although ideally a global assessment should incorporate full data from all regions to derive robust evaluations, the available information on the geographic distribution of abundances suggests that the largest rookeries are concentrated in regions with good representation and thus their inclusion will not significantly affect the global results. This is reflected at the regional level and in results for non-arribada rookeries where our sample bias will probably have caused an underestimation of true decline levels. (3) The extent of extrapolations into time past is an aspect that will undoubtedly contribute to the uncertainty of the results, particularly with scarce information. We have avoided extrapolating far beyond the oldest datasets to avoid this type of errors and thus consider that our results are conservative.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rationale for the Red List Assessment</span>:<br/>In spite of scarcity in historical data, information from diverse sources has made it possible to evaluate a global decline for this widely distributed species over time periods ranging from decades to 2-3 generations. Striking regional differences are observed in the estimations that undoubtedly indicate far lower survival probabilities in some of the regions than what the global results would suggest.<br/><br/>There was also a stark and recurring contrast between the decline estimates for subpopulations grouped according to breeding strategy- arribada or non-arribada (solitary). The global decline rate estimated from non-arribada subpopulations (-63 to -83%) reflects a widespread low conservation status for these types of subpopulations that suggests they haven’t recovered to historical (pre 1960) levels even in regions with long-term protection programs (e.g., over four decades in México) in spite generalized increments over the last decade (Márquez <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). This needs to be highlighted because rookeries with non-arribada behavior are many times more numerous than those that nest as arribadas (e.g., in México about 98% of Olive Ridley subpopulations are non-arribada). Yet, as their abundances are up to three to four orders of magnitude smaller than arribada rookeries, they have an insignificant influence on the global decline estimates. In fact, the global net decline for the Olive Ridley is driven principally by population trends in just two arribada populations, Escobilla (México) and Ostional (Costa Rica), both in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>The global decline value estimated on the basis of estimated population reductions of the annual number of Olive Ridley nesting females at subpopulations in the Index Sites used ranged between 31 and 36% (see Table 3 in the Supplementary Material, see below). As most of the back extrapolations were limited to two generations it is likely that this value is conservative.<br/><br/>When deciding whether to apply Red List decline criterion A1 (the causes of reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased) or A2 (the causes of reduction may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible) to obtain decline thresholds for the listing process three characteristics of the species’ decline need to be analyzed (SPWG 2006): (1) is the reduction reversible?, (2) are the causes of the reduction identified and understood?, and (3) have the threatening factors ceased? Since the decline estimated is driven by result from arribada rookeries, the questions need to be addressed against what is known for these types of populations. While it would appear that the elimination of large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley for leather and local consumption has allowed for the stabilization of a significant portion of rookeries, particularly in the Eastern Pacific and in particular facilitated the growth of arribada rookeries such as Escobilla and Ostional, the population growth of Mismaloya, Tlalcoyunque and Chacahua in the same region and under similar conservation circumstances remain at reduced abundances well below an arribada category. This could indicate that under some circumstances, the reduction of arribada rookeries below a certain level can make it impossible or unlikely for it to recover an arribada behavior. The major cause for the reduction in the species is thought to have been the massive commercial over-exploitations, particularly in the Eastern Pacific. Furthermore, we do not yet fully understand nor are able to manage other stressors, some intrinsic or at least due to interactions between the overcrowding of growing populations that equally provoke dramatic declines in arribadas such as that of Nancite in spite of decades of protection (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Though commercial exploitation of Olive Ridleys for international markets has effectively been eliminated, at local levels significant factors continue to impact individual rookeries such as excessive egg exploitation (e.g., Isla Caña, Panama) or bycatch (such as in Orissa, India). These examples indicate that Olive Ridleys, under current circumstances, do not meet all of the conditions for A1 and hence should be evaluated under criterion A2.<br/><br/>Under A2, the decline estimations obtained for the Olive Ridley Turtle at a global scale correspond to the Vulnerable IUCN Red List threshold (a decline of &gt;30% but &lt;50%.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Like most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (Márquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adults’ habitats (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), commonly within the 20°C isotherms (Márquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30°N to 15°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Demographic features / Reproduction</span><br/>The species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or “solitary” with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100–110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; Márquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).","Like other long-lived species, Olive Ridleys are prone to population declines because of slow intrinsic growth rate in combination with anthropogenic impacts. These can accumulate over a protracted development through various life stages, multiple habitats (nesting beaches, migratory routes and pelagic foraging zones) and vast geographic expanses.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Targeted exploitation</span><br/>Egg harvest. Olive Ridleys and their eggs have been harvested, mostly unsustainably, worldwide. However, the current impact is difficult to evaluate because of other simultaneous factors such as incidental take in commercial fisheries. Nonetheless, there is documentation of recent egg use causing declines (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). From México to Colombia, Olive Ridley eggs have been and still are used for personal and commercial use (Lagueux 1989, Arauz 2000, Campbell 2007, Cornelius et al. 2007). Laws regulating turtle egg use vary among countries, and even where laws prohibit egg use, illegal use of Olive Ridley eggs is believed to be widespread because enforcement is either non-existent or insufficient. On unprotected solitary nesting beaches (most are unprotected), egg extraction often approaches 100%. Human use of turtle eggs for consumption and domestic animal consumption historically was widespread in the Indian Ocean and continues today largely wherever Ridleys nest (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Egg use has been reported in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Pakistan and Malaysia and is believed to have caused the decline of Olive Ridleys in these countries (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Even at monitored beaches a proportion of the eggs are still lost to poaching.<br/><br/>Directed take of adults. In the East Pacific, although Olive Ridley turtle fisheries are now closed, illegal take of adult turtles still occurs widely with an unknown level of impact. There is evidence that thousands of Olive Ridleys are still taken each year along the Pacific coast of México (Frazier et al. 2007). In the West Atlantic, the direct take of adults has diminished over time to negligible levels (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). In the Indian Ocean, the use of adult Olive Ridleys and their eggs for personal use has been and continues to be widespread (Frazier 1982, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), and market-driven harvesting of eggs and females from nesting beaches are considered the greatest threat (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Personal, subsistence use of adult Olive Ridley turtles is widespread worldwide (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Olive Ridleys and/or their eggs are used along the entire coast of West Africa (including Macaronesia) and sold in local and regional markets (Fretey 2001).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bycatch in fisheries</span><br/>The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys occurs worldwide in trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seines, gill net and other net fisheries and hook and line fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). The impact of the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in fisheries has been well documented for some regions but not for others. In some locations where by-catch statistics are unavailable from fisheries, cause and effect has been used to implicate a fishery in the decline of Olive Ridleys. The incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in the shrimp trawl fishery in the western Atlantic, is believed to be the main cause of the significant population decline observed there since the 1970s and currently the number of Olive Ridleys by caught in trawl fisheries off the coasts of Surinam and French Guiana is believed to be approximately a couple of thousand turtles annually (Godfrey and Chevalier 2004, Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Gillnets and other fishing methods in this region also capture Olive Ridleys incidentally but to a lesser extent than shrimp trawl fishery (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Bycatch in trawl fisheries off Sergipe State in Brazil is considered the most pressing threat to that population (Thomé <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the eastern Atlantic, the incidental capture of Olive Ridleys by commercial fisheries is thought to be a significant threat but very little systematic data is available (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental mortality of Olive Ridleys is worst along the coast of Orissa, India with arribada Olive Ridleys gathering to nest were fishing effort is high. Every year since the early 1980s, thousands or tens of thousands of Olive Ridleys have stranded dead on the Orissa beaches, presumably as a result of incidental capture in shrimp trawls (Pandav 2000). A gill net fishery also operates in the region and contributes to the ridley mortality along this coastline. Incidental capture in fisheries is also believed to be a serious threat in the eastern Pacific (Frazier et al. 2007) where Olive Ridleys aggregate in large numbers off shore from nesting beaches (Kalb <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995, Kalb 1999), but the information available is incomplete (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995, NMFS/USFWS 1998). Incidental capture of Olive Ridleys in this region has been documented in shrimp trawl fisheries, longline fisheries, purse seine fishery and gill net fisheries (Frazier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). Incidental capture of sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a serious threat along the coast of Central America, with an estimated annual capture for all species of marine turtle exceeding 60,000 turtles, most of which are Olive Ridleys (Arauz 1996). Recent growth in the longline fisheries of this region are also a serious and growing threat to Olive Ridleys and have the potential to capture hundreds of thousands of Ridleys annually (Frazier et al., 2007). Bycatch of Olive Ridleys is high in Indonesian tuna long-lines and shrimp trawls although mortality appears to be low (WWF Indonesia, unpublished data).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitat impacts</span><br/>Degradation, transformation and destruction of natural conditions at nesting beaches from coastal developments continue to threaten the long-term survival of many Olive Ridley rookeries. Transformation of nesting habitat comes from the construction of new aquaculture ponds, fishing harbours and tourist facilities, as well as growth of existing coastal villages which are increasing in many parts of the world within the range of the Olive Ridley, particularly along the east coast of India (Pandav and Choudhury 1999) and in some zones in coastal México to Central America (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007). These impacts contribute stress directly through the loss of nesting habitat or indirectly through changes in the thermal profiles of the beach, increased light pollution (Witherington 1992) and sewage effluents.<br/><br/>Global warming has the potential to impact the habitats and ecosystems of Olive Ridley populations worldwide (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, Weishampal 2004) but the specific impacts are purely speculative at this time. Most accounts have focused on the impact of global warming on incubation temperatures of eggs, which influence the sex ratio of the embryos (Hays <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Diseases and predation</span><br/>Extremely little is known about diseases and their effects on Olive Ridley abundance. The only disease identified in the literature for Olive Ridleys is fibropapilloma, a herpes-virus found in sea turtles nearly worldwide (Herbst 1994). The incidence of fibropapilloma is not believed to be high in Olive Ridleys but has been observed in Olive Ridleys nesting in Costa Rica (Herbst 1994) and in México (Vasconcelos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). At some individual rookeries, the predation by wild pigs and/or feral dogs can be substantial (e.g., in the Andaman Islands; Andrews et al. 2001). Infestation of developing eggs by fly and beetle larvae can cause significant mortality of embryos. In an extremely worrying case, the beetle larvae (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Omorgus suberosus fabricius</span>) has become a plague in the world’s largest arribada rookery in Escobilla, México where it is provoking steep drops in the hatching efficiency of the clutches laid, from a typical 30% for this colony (Márquez 1990) to less than 5% in some areas (López-Reyes and Harfush 2000). When combined with the relatively low hatching rates of high-density arribada beaches and the destruction of eggs laid by previous nesters, this problem could provoke the rookery’s decline.","<p>For the purposes of Red List assessments, generation length is defined as the “average age of parents” (IUCN 2001). Since this information is not available from direct observation of sea turtle species we derived a comparable value from estimates of age at which 50% of the breeders are expected to have survived, using information for age at sexual maturity and adult survival rates. An important caveat is that, while it is known that different populations of the same species can attain sexual maturity at different ages (Heppell <em>et al.</em> 2003) and therefore different values would need to be taken into account for different regions, the information is only available for a single region and we have had to assume the estimated values are generally applicable on a global scale. The only published study on growth and age for Olive Ridleys (Zug <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates a mean age at sexual maturity for North-central Pacific Ridley sea turtles of around 13 years (range of 10-18 years). We calculated the time it would take for a cohort of breeders to reach 50% of its original size from S<sup>n</sup> =50%, where <span times="""" new="""" roman="""">n is years since age at first reproduction, and S is annual survival. Solving for n, n = ln(0.5)/ln(S). As extensive estimates of annual survival rates for female nesters are only available from the better studied sister taxon, <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, (TEWG 2000) we used these, which have a range of 85-92% per year. Thus, n<sub>50% </sub>= 4-9 yrs and our derived average age of female Olive Ridley parents is 17-22 years. We additionally assumed that this value would be the same for male parents. For simplicity, we have used a value of 20 yrs for the species’ generation length in this assessment.</p>",Decreasing,"The Olive Ridley sea turtle has a circumtropical distribution, with nesting occurring throughout tropical waters (except the Gulf of Mexico) and migratory circuits in tropical and some subtropical areas (Atlantic Ocean – eastern central, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, western central; Indian Ocean – eastern, western; Pacific Ocean – eastern central, northwest, southwest, western central) (Pritchard 1969). Nesting occurs in nearly 60 countries worldwide. Migratory movements are less well studied than other marine turtle species but are known to involve coastal waters of over 80 countries (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material, see below). With very few exceptions they are not known to move between ocean basins or to cross from one ocean border to the other. Within a region, Olive Ridleys may move between the oceanic and neritic zones (Plotkin <em>et al.</em> 1995, Shanker <em>et al</em>. 2003) or just occupy neritic waters (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Most of the conservation actions on behalf of the Olive Ridley at national and international levels have been based on the species’ listing under the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Endangered </span>category in the IUCN Red List. As an Appendix I species under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) the international trade of skins from the species, which fuelled the large scale commercial exploitation of the Olive Ridley from the 1960s into the 1980s was effectively halted. Other relevant international instruments that list the Olive Ridley as threatened and hence obligate its conservation by member states include: the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC). CMS-promoted Memoranda of Understanding for the conservation and management of marine turtles and their habitats have been signed by the Olive Ridley’s range states in the Indian Ocean and South East Asia (known as IOSEA) as well as in other regions such as the Atlantic Coast of Africa under the Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa where 21 out of 26 range states participate.<br/><br/>On the basis of the species’ classification in the IUCN Red List or in national endangered species lists, local legislatures of range states confer protection to the Olive Ridley. Although this sanctions law-enforcement, the implementation remains patchy at the global scale because of paucity in enforcement capabilities. Successful conservation has usually relied on well-coordinated national programs in combination with local and non-governmental organizations incorporating public outreach. Statutory use and enforcement of the Turtle Excluder Devices in the shrimp trawlers has also proven critical in some areas with high levels of interaction with this fishery.<br/><br/>Despite the legislative efforts to protect the Olive Ridley, human impacts continue to be significant. In some areas (such as West Africa and South East Asia), extensive monitoring needs to be implemented to identify regions and stressors requiring priority actions. Bycatch and illegal take particularly from the coastal, artisanal fisheries need to be evaluated through adequate on-board observer programs and properly addressed. The beetle infestation of the Escobilla rookery must be adequately evaluated and acceptable measures of biological control of the insect need to be implemented. The impact from the increasing development of much of the range state’s coastline has to be evaluated and suitable mitigation measures implemented.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The ruling was the conclusion to an appeals process which was initiated following a petition against the 1996 listing of this species (for further details see the <a href=""http://iucn.org/themes/ssc/redlists/petitions.html"">IUCN SSC web site</a>). <br/> <br/>This ruling is based on the information that was available in 1995, when the listing was made, and on the 1994 Red List Criteria, on which the listing was based.  Thus, the S&PS did not consider information that became available after 1995, and the changes to the IUCN criteria that took effect in 2001. The rationale provided by the S&PS for the ruling is as follows: <br/> <br/> <br/>The petitioner claimed that future reduction due to pollutants, pathogens, and introduced taxa (criterion A2e), due to reduction in area of occupancy (A2c), or due to exploitation by indigenous people (A2d) was not evident.  The Marine Turtle Specialist Group (MTSG) justification referred to reported losses due to introduced foxes, feral dogs and pigs, reports of green turtle fibropapillomatosis in flatbacks, evidence of threats to habitat quality, and reports of accidental mortality by prawn trawling and coastal gill nets. <br/> <br/>Although it is clear that there are reasons why some declines may be expected in the future, there is no quantitative evidence to suggest 20% decline in the next 3 generations.  There is always going to be substantial uncertainty in using criterion A2 (future reduction) with long-lived species.  This difficulty is further compounded here by lack of any specific quantitative information. <br/> <br/>Thus, the S&PS believes that the information provided does not justify the use of criterion A2.  However, considering that (as the MTSG states) this is one of the most poorly understood marine turtle species, and that the qualitative information provided suggests declines are possible, future reduction of 20% or more cannot be ruled out.  For this reason, the S&PS decided that the appropriate listing for this species is Data Deficient (DD). <br/> <br/>The justification by the MTSG also indicated that the flatback turtle has one of the most restricted geographic ranges of any marine turtle species.  However, it did not provide data on the extent of occurrence or area of occupancy, and the listing was based on future reduction (criterion A2) not on restricted range (criterion B).  Thus, the S&PS encourages the MTSG to assess this species in the future under Criterion B as well as Criterion A.",Terrestrial nest sites,,,,,,Terrestrial|Marine,,Australasian,,false,false,Global

This habitat impact was compounded by the removal of at least 20-25% of the total estimated population of adults in the three-year period 2000-2002. Combined, this indicates a minimum of 60% population decline in the past two generations, with a further 30% anticipated for the next generation, qualifying the species as Critically Endangered under criterion A4acd. Population modelling predicting extinction before 2030 is no longer applicable as some of the the modelling assumptions are no longer operational.","The forests inhabited by <em>Pyxis planicauda</em> grow on loose sandy soils and the tortoises take refuge amongst the leaf litter of the forest floor. They burrow and are inactive in leaf litter during dry season (late May through October), but become active in the wet season. They are crepuscular and seek shelter during mid-day (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989, Rakotombololona 1998, Gibson and Buley 2004). Tortoises feed on fallen fruits such as <em>Breonia perrieri</em> and <em>Aleanthus greveanus</em>. (Glaw and Vences 1994, Gibson and Buley 2004). Fungi and fallen flowers have also been reported as diet items (Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/>Adult <em>P. planicauda</em> reach a carapace length of 13.7 cm (Ernst <em>et al</em>. 2000) to 14.8 cm (Pedrono 2008). Based on information from Durrell Wildlife breeding center in northwestern Madagascar females do not reach maturity until ten years of age. Generation time was estimated at the 2008 Madagascar Tortoise and Freswater Turtle workshop as at least 25 years. Mating occurs in the first half of the wet season and females produce 1-3 single egg clutches in the latter half of the wet season (Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2003, Pedrono 2008). Observation of nests in the wild, show incubation periods of 250-340 days (Razandrimamilafiniarivo <em>et al</em>. 2000).","<em>Pyxis planicauda</em> is exclusively associated with closed-canopy dry forest and its major threat comes from habitat loss, particularly from burning and clearing for agricultural lands/cattle grazing, highway development, mining, and petroleum exploration (Tidd <em>et al</em>. 2001, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bonin <em>et al</em>. 2006). Analyses of satellite imagery by Tidd <em>et al</em>. (2001) between 1963 and 1993 showed a 32% reduction in the primary dry forests. Deforestation rates have increased, and up to 50% of the 76,000 ha remaining in the southern portion of the tortoises range may be destroyed before 2010. A 50% reduction in the remaining 73,000 ha of habitat in the northern portion of its known range may occur by 2040 (Tidd <em>et al</em>. 2001), for a combined forest habitat loss estimated at over 70% in the period 1963-2040. Similar deforestation rates were documented by Harper <em>et al</em>. (2007). <br/><br/>Secondary pressure comes from collection for the pet trade (Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2003, Bonin <em>et al</em>. 2006); a pulse of exploitation for pet trade export removed about 4,000 adult animals during 2000 to 2002, representing 20 to 40% of the total number of adults (depending on total population estimates). The reproductive capacity and recruitment potential of this species are particularly low, even by tortoise standards. <br/><br/>The species is not consumed locally or traded locally/regionally. <br/><br/>Population modelling at the 2001 CAMP workshop (CBSG 2001) predicted extinction before 2030 based on rates of habitat loss and pet trade collection then in effect, but legal export trade is no longer permitted and thus the modelling assumptions are no longer valid. <br/><br/><em>Pyxis planicauda</em> was recommended to be listed as Critically Endangered (CR A3acd + B1b) at the 2001 CAMP workshop (CBSG 2001).","Based on density estimates, habitat reduction and trade figures it is believed that the total population of <em>P. planicauda</em> is less than 10, 000 animals (Anonymous 2001).

The species'  extent of occurrence covered an estimated area of 123,610 km²  less than three generations ago. Today it is estimated at around 16,600 km².  Within the same period population sizes are estimated to have reduced by over 85% from around 55,600 to 7,470 individuals, of which approximately 5,000 are mature individuals. This figure is less than the number of animals recorded from the illegal pet trade in the 1990s alone. Fairly good habitat patches still exist in Libya but the global population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> could realistically face extinction in less than 20 years or around one generation if degradation of landscape and trade cannot be stopped.","<em>T. kleinmanni</em> populations in northern Egypt are historically associated with desert and semi-desert habitats characterized or dominated by compact sand and gravel plains with scattered rocks and shallow sandy wadis, although populations were also known to occur in or adjacent to coastal salt marsh habitats (Lortet 1887, Baha El Din 1994). The majority of the species' primary habitats in Egypt are currently severely degraded, or already completely destroyed (Baha El Din 1994). 
<br/>
<br/>In Cyrenaica, northeastern Libya, the species occurs in shrubby sand and stone desert habitats (coast) and semidesert habitats with Artemisia association (further inland), according to Schleich (1987, 1989). Schleich <em>et al.</em> (1996) consider the species to occupy generally the margins of sandy, or dry stony, habitats. <em>T. kleinmanni</em> can apparently also be found (together with <em>Testudo graeca</em> species complex tortoises) in more vegetated Mediterranean subtropical shrub evergreen forests, as can be inferred from Schleich (1989) who cites Suluntah as a locality. It is however not clear how typical this habitat association is for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in northeastern Libya, thus it is probably most appropriate to describe the species' primary habitat preference in Cyrenaica as Mediterranean scrub. Habitats are still in fairly good condition in Libya, but there are signs of extensive overgrazing in many parts, particularly in Cyrenaica, and ploughing for growing cereals is a common practice, and trends and plans for habitat utilization are unclear (S. Baha El Din 2002). According to fieldwork by A. Pieh (pers. comm.), in Cyrenaica habitat is locally still very good near Suluntah, and reasonably well preserved in the wadi system near Darnah. However, habitat on the whole coastal stretch between Darnah and Tubruq is severely degraded possibly due to extensive, and continuing, nomadic activity in that area. In Tripolitania habitat degradation due to human expansion is very evident on the coast east of Al Khums around Leptis Magna, whereas habitat in more southerly areas towards the inland near Gharyan ""looks better"" (A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Further, according to Pieh (pers. comm.), the coastline between Al Khums and the Tunisian border features occasional spots of undisturbed habitat.","In addition to agricultural (including overgrazing), developmental and industrial pressures, <em>T. kleinmanni</em> was very heavily affected by the (eventually illegal) national and international pet trade that began using the Libyan stock after Egyptian subpopulations were harvested to extinction (Baha El Din 1994). The brochure of Tortoise Care (The Egyptian Tortoise Conservation Program) (Anonymous 2000) as well as S. Baha El Din (2002) list the illegal trade in <em>T. kleinmanni</em> of Libyan origin within Egypt as continuing. Trade in <em>T. kleinmanni</em> also exists within Libya itself (Fritz and Buskirk 1997; Pieh. pers. comm.; S. Baha El Din 2002), with potentially devastating consequences for the remaining world population. According to locals, collection pressure is higher in the east than in the west. Tortoises have a low annual biomass production resulting in a high degree of sensitivity to population disturbance and consequent poor recovery abilities from such activities as trade collection (Iverson 1982).","Currently, the species is effectively extinct within Egypt. Baha El Din (1994) surveyed the whole former range of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in Egypt and concluded that the species disappeared completely within a period of approximately 10 to 20 years (between the early 1970s and the early 1990s). This time frame is estimated to represent around, or slightly more than, one generation length for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, taking into consideration that maturity is probably reached at about 10-20 years in the wild as is the case in several other species of testudinids living in semiarid or arid conditions (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Brushko 1977, review in: Kuzmin 2002). In 2001, two wild tortoises were found in a protected coastal area in the Western Desert, the first record for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in Egypt in over twenty years (M. Baha El Din 2002). This finding, although significant <em>per se</em>, does naturally nothing to change the fact that <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is effectively extinct in Egypt. 
<br/>
<br/>The species can still be found in  two distinct, and geographically disjunct regions in Libya (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica).
<br/>
<br/>Judging by data produced in Iverson (1992), Buskirk (1985) and Baha El Din (1994), the species' extent of occurrence in Egypt, possibly up to the early 1970s, is estimated as having been around 67,860 km². According to available data (Buskirk 1985, Iverson 1986, 1992, Fritz and Buskirk 1997, Perälä 2001, Pieh, pers. comm.), the small northwestern (Tripolitanian) range encompasses an estimated extent of occurrence of around 5,500 km². Nothing is known about local population densities but A. Pieh (pers. comm.) concluded <em>in situ</em> that the coastal subpopulation has to be severely fragmented because of a mosaic of badly degraded habitat. The estimated extent of occurrence for present Cyrenaican population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is around 11,100 km², as measured using a minimum convex polygon and locality data provided by S. Baha El Din (2002), and Pieh (pers. comm.). Some 40 years ago the Cyrenaican <em>T. kleinmanni</em> population had possibly an estimated extent of occurrence of 50,250 km² as calculated using data from Buskirk (1985), Iverson (1992), and Perälä (2001), as well as assuming that the distribution was continuous from Cyrenaica to western Egypt. The isolated locality of ""Sirtica"" (Loveridge and Williams 1957) some 300 km west of Qaminis (Gheminez) in western Cyrenaica was not taken into account.
<br/>
<br/>Because no fieldwork based data on the area of occupancy exist for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, the area of occupancy is  defined as 10% of the area of extent of occurrence, yielding estimations of total past area of occupancy 12,361 km² and total present area of occupancy 1,660 km².
<br/>
<br/>20 years ago, Mendelssohn (1982) estimated  the global population size of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> (including <em>T. werneri</em> from Sinai and Israel) at less than 10,000 individuals, including immature tortoises. This figure seems to be an underestimation regarding current estimates and statistics on trade. Mendelssohn (1982) also was not aware of the existence of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in northwestern Libya, which was therefore not taken into account in his assessment. Although no population density assessments based on local field data have been published for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in mainland Egypt and Libya, densities are thought to be very low (Buskirk 1985, Schleich 1989, Baha El Din 1994, M. Baha El Din 2002, S. Baha El Din 2002, A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Locals in Libya stated in April 2002 that populations of the species still exist in many parts of Cyrenaica, but that they have declined notably in recent years due to collection (S. Baha El Din 2002). Perälä (2002) estimates the past total world population at 55,624 individuals, substantially more than the estimate by Mendelssohn (1982). The total present world  population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is estimated at 7,470 individuals (Perälä 2002), which  is considerably less than the number of recorded animals collected in Libya for the pet trade in the 1990s. Out of the existing global population around 75% (5,000 individuals) would be mature adults if Mendelssohn's (1982) data on population structure for <em>T. werneri</em> is applicable for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>. According to the above estimate, the global population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> would have declined by 86.6% (or by 48,152 individuals) in less than three generations. Out of these, at least 10,680 individuals have been recorded from the illegal pet trade in the 1990s alone (Baha El Din 1994, Ventura 1995, Pieh, pers. comm.). Because relatively good habitat still exists in Libya it is possible that the earlier inferred reduction in the extent of occurrence  primarily reflects pressure from collection and illegal trade, rather than habitat degradation (in Libya).",Decreasing,"Populations east of the Nile delta in Egypt and in Israel formerly assigned to <em>T. kleinmanni</em> have been shown to encompass a separate species <em>Testudo werneri</em> (Perälä 2001). Consequently, this assessment does not take into account information based on the above geographical region traditionally incorporated into papers on <em>T. kleinmanni</em> (Perälä 2002). <br/> <br/>Historically, the range of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> runs along the Mediterranean coastal strip up to about 90-120 km, exceptionally further, towards inland in Libya (where disjunct populations exist in Tripolitania and in the Cyrenaican Peninsula) and more or less continuously from northeastern Libya to the Western Desert and the north coast in mainland Egypt (Lortet 1883, 1887, Loveridge and Williams 1957, Buskirk 1985, Iverson 1986, 1992, Baha El Din 1994, Fritz and Buskirk 1997, Perälä 2001). The range has possibly been much greater in the past, and localities further inland or in the west, such as Siwa Oasis and the Tripolitanian range respectively, may represent the last remnants of a more extensive distribution in historical times which could have decreased with the natural aridification and expansion of the Saharan desert. Thus <em>a priori</em> treatments of isolated occurrences of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> as human introductions, or as extralimital, should be viewed with caution.",,Terrestrial,"Whereas <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is covered by international conservation policies (the species is included in CITES Appendix I), and although it is protected by Egyptian law (Baha El Din 1994; Anonymous 2000), the species is unprotected in Libya (Anonymous 2000; S. Baha El Din 2002). However, recent information (M. Baha El Din 2002; S. Baha El Din 2002) suggests that the Libyan Environment General Authority and local academics show interest for tortoise conservation in Libya, and that they are looking forward to cooperating with the Egyptian based TortoiseCare program. Despite protection of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> by law in Egypt, the law is not implemented at all times (Baha El Din 1994; Anonymous 2000). S. Baha El Din (2002) indicates that TortoiseCare will continue to seek funding for future activities for the conservation of <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, and particularly for the development of a species action plan that takes into consideration the conservation needs of the species on a global level, including both Egypt and Libya.  <br/> <br/>Populations from Sinai and Israel, attributed traditionally to <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, were shown to comprise a separate species (Perälä 2001). However, the limited data available suggest that the geographically isolated subpopulation of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> from Tripolitania might additionally be taxonomically distinct. It is essential that local subpopulations are not mixed in any circumstances, including possible breeding projects, whether in or ex situ. The use of captive or confiscated stock of unknown origins or parentage in conservation programs should be discouraged at all times for the same reasons. <br/> <br/>Data for uses and harvest levels are largely known for Egypt only (Baha El Din 1994) where monitoring is continuing (Anonymous 2000). No data are available for Libya. <br/> <br/>Conservation measures are going on in Egypt (M. Baha El Din 2002) but not yet in Libya. More research is needed also in Egypt, such as a systematic search and identification of habitat pockets where tortoises might still exist. <br/> <br/>Protected areas exist in Egypt, including the one in which two individuals were recently found, and more are needed according to Baha El Din (1994), Anonymous (2000) and M. Baha El Din (2002). The motives for establishing new protected areas especially for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> are not entirely clear as the species is already effectively extinct in Egypt. Reintroduction projects have been currently stalled in Egypt (M. Baha El Din 2002). <em>T. kleinmanni</em> may occur in Kouf National Park in NE Libya (Schleich 1987) where one specimen was found 20 years ago (FMNH collection data). Other Libyan reserves in areas of tortoise activity are nonexistent (S. Baha El Din 2002). Protected areas would greatly enhance the survival prospects of the entire species if trade can be stopped.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It ranges up to 1300m, but mostly occurs below 800m. It generally prefers drier, hotter areas than the sympatric <em>T. hermanni boettgeri</em>. (Willemsen 1995b; Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). Clutches consist of four to seven eggs, perhaps up to 15; females produce one to three clutches per year (review by Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). Animals require about eight to 14 years to reach maturity (review by Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). <em>Testudo m. weissinge</em>ri inhabits both Phrygana (Spartan shrubby rocky areas) as well as more lush habitats such as olive groves with dense herbaceous ground cover (Artner 2000;  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 309-311). This taxon ranges from near sea level to about 1,300m altitude (Mueller1908, Bour 1996, in Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 311), and feeds on a variety of herbs (Bour 1996, in  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 312). Its clutch size is a maximum of four, perhaps six eggs (Bour 1996, in  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 314; Artner 2000).","The main threat is wildfires. It is less impacted by agricultural land conversion and practices than the sympatric <em>T. hermanni boettgeri </em>due to <em>T. marginata</em>'s preference for stony habitats (Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). Tourist infrastructure development eliminates some habitat. There is some mortality recorded from fires and trampling of juveniles by livestock, and destruction by farmers as perceived crop pests (Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). Some collection for (illegal) pet trade might still take place.","It is generally considered to occur at low densities (Stubbs 1989c). Willemsen (1995b) and Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. (2001) note that the preferred habitat of the species is very hard to penetrate and survey, thus records of low-density occurrence might pertain to marginal habitats. A population in Sardinia that was perceived as intensively collected in the 1950s persists at 'normal' density (Stemmler, Fritz, in Bringsoe <em>et al</em>., 2001: 318). Populations of <em>T.m. weissingeri </em>are apparently dense, as Bour (1996) examined 384 animals and Artner (1996) encountered 30 animals in four hours, and 80 animals in two days. Bour (1996) recorded a male-dominated population structure, and very few juveniles (juveniles of <em>T. marginata</em> are very cryptic) (data summarised in  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 317). It is a very rare and localised species in Albania (Haxhiu, 2004).",Stable,"This species occurs mainly in northwestern, central and sothern Greece, and adjoining extreme southern Albania, including a number of islands (Kyra Panagia, Valaxa, Paris, Salamis, Sfakythiria, Spetsopoula, and possibly Korfu), as well as northeastern Sardinia and satellite islands, plus Isola di San Pietro off southwestern Sardinia. Sardinian occurrences may be the result of human introduction in the Classical era (see Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 300).  It is also introduced on Crete. The subspecies <em>T.m. weissingeri</em> occurs in west Taygetos mountains of the Peloponnesus, southern Greece, and small area that stretches for about 50 km North-South, but only 2-5 km East-West (Bour, in Artner, 200: 34).

11037468,4615,Chelonia mydas,Endangered,A2bd,2004,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Analysis of historic and recent published accounts indicate extensive subpopulation declines in all major ocean basins over the last three generations as a result of overexploitation of eggs and adult females at nesting beaches, juveniles and adults in foraging areas, and, to a lesser extent, incidental mortality relating to marine fisheries and degradation of marine and nesting habitats. Analyses of subpopulation changes at 32 Index Sites distributed globally (Figure 1, Table 1; see the supplementary material) show a 48% to 67% decline in the number of mature females nesting annually over the last 3–generations. <br/> <br/><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong> In accord with the IUCN criterion that Red List Assessments focus on the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001a), this assessment measures changes in the annual number of nesting females. Because reliable data are not available for all subpopulations, the present report focuses on 32 Index Sites (Figure 1, Table 1; see the supplementary material). These Index Sites include all of the known major nesting areas as well as many of the lesser nesting areas for which quantitative data are available. Despite considerable overlap at some foraging areas, each is presumed to be genetically distinct (Bowen <em>et al</em>. 1992, Bowen 1995) except for the Turtle Islands of Malaysia (Sabah) and Philippines (Moritz <em>et al</em>. 1991). These two Index Sites are, however, treated independently because of the different management practices exercised by the two governments and the resultant differences in subpopulation trends. Selection of the 32 Index Sites was based on two primary assumptions: (1) they represent the overall regional subpopulation trends and (2) the number of individuals among Index Sites in each region is proportional to the actual population size in that region. Any regional inconsistencies in this proportion may result in a biased global population estimate. <br/> <br/>It should be noted that a major caveat of using the number of nesting females to assess population trends is that this data type provides information for the proportion of the adult females that nest in any given year, not the total adult female population. However, when monitored over many years, this index can be reliable for assessing long-term population trends (Meylan 1982, Limpus 1996). In the case of green turtles, which display high inter-annual variability in magnitude of nesting (Limpus and Nichols 1987, Broderick <em>et al</em>. 2001a), using short-term or single-season data sets could misrepresent the actual mean number of nesters over a longer timeframe.  To alleviate this potential source of error, we used multiple-year data sets whenever available. However, when single-season datasets represented the only quantitative information for a given time period, these data were used as long as they were in accord with qualitative information from other references. <br/> <br/>Because data on annual number of nesting females are not always available, we also used data on number of nests per season, annual hatchling production, annual egg production and annual egg harvest. When these proxies were used, we converted units to number of nesting females based on a constant figure of 100 eggs/nest and three nests/season/female, unless otherwise noted. These conversions were based on the assumptions that (1) the mean number of eggs/nest and nests/female/season differ insignificantly through time, and (2) efforts to monitor nesting female activity and egg production are consistent through time. When using egg harvest data, we also assumed that harvest effort was consistent during all years for which data are available and 100% of the eggs were harvested in any given year. We believe these assumptions are accurate, but their absolute validation is very difficult. Qualitative information does, however, suggest that they are reasonable assumptions. For example, in the case of historic egg harvest, the same group of people usually harvested the eggs at a particular nesting beach each year, and they typically took every egg they could find (e.g., Parsons 1962, Pelzer 1972). <br/> <br/>In the present assessment, population abundance estimates are based on raw data, linear extrapolation functions, and exponential extrapolation functions. In most subpopulations, more than one trajectory was exhibited over the 3–generation interval; changes in subpopulation size are thus often based on a combination of raw data and extrapolations. If no change is believed to have occurred outside the time interval for which published abundance data are available, the raw data were used to determine the change in population size. However, when it is believed that change in subpopulation abundance occurred outside the interval for which raw data were available, extrapolations we performed to determine the overall change.  Linear extrapolations were used when it was believed that the same amount of change occurred each year, irrespective of total subpopulation size. Exponential extrapolations were used when it was believed that change was proportional to the subpopulation size. In cases where there is a lack of information on the specific rate of change, both linear and exponential extrapolations were used to derive population estimates. However, if extrapolations resulted in obviously false estimates, their results were discarded (see Table 5; see the supplementary material). <br/> <br/><strong>Generation Length.</strong> Generation length is based on the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (Pianka 1974). Although there appears to be considerable variation in generation length among sea turtle species, it is apparent that all are relatively slow maturing and long-lived (Chaloupka and Musick 1997). Green turtles exhibit particularly slow growth rates, and age to maturity for the species appears to be the longest of any sea turtle (Hirth 1997). As a result, this assessment uses the most appropriate age-at-maturity estimates for each index site. At Index Sites for which there are local age-to-maturity data, those data are used to establish generation length. When data are lacking, as they are for a majority of subpopulations, information from the closest subpopulation for which data are available are used to generate age-at-maturity estimates (Table 2; see the supplementary material). <br/> <br/>Estimates of reproductive longevity range from 17 y to 23 y (Carr <em>et al</em>. 1978, Fitzsimmons <em>et al</em>. 1995). Data from the apparently pristine Green Turtle stock at Heron Island in Australia’s southern Great Barrier Reef show a mean reproductive life of 19 y (Chaloupka <em>et al</em>. 2004). Because Heron Island is the only undisturbed stock for which reproductive longevity data are available (M. Chaloupka, pers. comm.), this datum is used for all Index Sites (Table 3; see the supplementary material). Thus, based on the range of ages-at-sexual-maturity (26 yrs to 40 yrs) and reproductive longevity from the undisturbed Australian stock (19 yr), the generation lengths used for this assessment range from 35.5 yrs to 49.5 yrs (Table 3; see the supplementary material). <br/> <br/><em>Uncertainties in assessment process:</em> As with any assessment based on historic data or small datasets, there is a great deal of uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. The sources of uncertainty are rooted in both the procedure itself as well as in the stochastic nature green of turtle biology. Both sources of uncertainty are ultimately related to a lack of information, which can be a common issue when dealing with an animal as long-lived as a Green Turtle. <br/> <br/>First and foremost is the uncertainty related to the assumptions invoked for this assessment. For example, if, contrary to our assumption, efforts to monitor nesting female activity and egg production were not consistent through time, then our results may be biased. Similarly, our estimates may be inaccurate if harvest effort or the relative amount of eggs harvested was not consistent through time. In addition, the use of extrapolations may have resulted in erroneous estimates of population change. The potential for this increased when extrapolations were made over long time intervals, when they were based on short-term data sets, or if the start and/or end points of extrapolations were erroneous. <br/>  <br/>Uncertainty may also be tied to Green Turtle biology. In particular, the substantial variability in the proportion of a population that nests in any given year may result in inaccurate comparisons between past and present data sets. For example, if the proportion of a subpopulation’s adult female cohort nesting each year oscillates over decadal or longer time frames, then it is conceivable that our estimates of annual change in nesting numbers do not correspond to actual changes in the entire subpopulation. Moreover, if our conversion values for eggs/nest and nests/female/season are not accurate for the specific subpopulation being addressed, inaccuracies may result. Lastly, with respect to the migratory behaviour of green turtles, it is expected that each of the Index Sites included in this assessment represent a distinct subpopulation. Indeed, current genetic data support this claim, however, in the absence of complete data for all rookeries, it is possible that turtles moving back and forth between nesting areas in close proximity could have gone undetected. It is thus conceivable that a female could be counted twice. This would, of course, only be a problem when subpopulation size is based on an actual count of individual turtles visiting the beach. Although unlikely, it amounts to an additional source of uncertainty in this assessment. <br/> <br/><strong>Population trends.</strong> Based on the actual and extrapolated changes in subpopulation size at the 32 Index Sites, it is apparent that the mean annual number of nesting females has declined by 48% to 67% over the last three generations (Table 5; see the supplementary material). In addition, it is apparent that the degree of population change is not consistent among all Index Sites or among all regions (Tables 5 and 6; see the supplementary material). Because many of the threats that have led to these declines are not reversible and have not yet ceased, it is evident that green turtles face a measurable risk of extinction.  Based on this assessment, it is apparent that green turtles qualify for Endangered status under Criteria A2bd. <br/> <br/>The key supporting documentation is presented in the tables (see link to additional information below), and the full assessment is also available from <a href=""http://www.iucn-mtsg.org/red_list/"">the Marine Turtle Specialist Group web site</a>.","Like most sea turtles, green turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Hirth 1997). Upon leaving the nesting beach, it has been hypothesized that hatchlings begin an oceanic phase (Carr 1987), perhaps floating passively in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Carr and Meylan 1980, Witham 1991). After a number of years in the oceanic zone, these turtles recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in seagrass and/or marine algae where they forage and grow until maturity (Musick and Limpus 1997). Upon attaining sexual maturity green turtles commence breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas that are undertaken every few years (Hirth 1997). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones, often spanning thousands of kilometers (Carr 1986, Mortimer and Portier 1989). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (e.g., Limpus <em>et al</em>. 1994, Seminoff <em>et al</em>. 2003).","Green turtles, like other sea turtle species, are particularly susceptible to population declines because of their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts during all life-stages: from eggs to adults. Perhaps the most detrimental human threats to green turtles are the intentional harvests of eggs and adults from nesting beaches and juveniles and adults from foraging grounds. Unfortunately, harvest remains legal in several countries despite substantial subpopulation declines (e.g., Humphrey and Salm 1996, Fleming 2001, Fretey 2001). In addition, a number of incidental threats impact green turtles around the world. These threats affect both terrestrial and marine environments, and include bycatch in marine fisheries, habitat degradation at nesting beaches and feeding areas, and disease. Mortality associated with entanglement in marine fisheries is the primary incidental threat; the responsible fishing techniques include drift netting, shrimp trawling, dynamite fishing, and long-lining. Degradation of both nesting beach habitat and marine habitats also play a role in the decline of many Green Turtle stocks. Nesting habitat degradation results from the construction of buildings, beach armoring and re-nourishment, and/or sand extraction (Lutcavage <em>et al</em>. 1997). These factors may directly, through loss of beach habitat, or indirectly, through changing thermal profiles and increasing erosion, serve to decrease the quantity and quality of nesting area available to females, and may evoke a change in the natural behaviors of adults and hatchlings (Ackerman 1997). The presence of lights on or adjacent to nesting beaches alters the behavior of nesting adults (Witherington 1992) and is often fatal to emerging hatchlings as they are attracted to light sources and drawn away from the water (Witherington and Bjorndal 1990). Habitat degradation in the marine environment results from increased effluent and contamination from coastal development, construction of marinas, increased boat traffic, and harvest of nearshore marine algae resources. Combined, these impacts diminish the health of coastal marine ecosystems and may, in turn, adversely affect green turtles. For example, degradation of marine habitats has been implicated in the increasing prevalence of the tumor-causing Fibropapilloma disease (George 1997).",,Decreasing,"The Green Turtle has a circumglobal distribution, occurring throughout tropical and, to a lesser extent, subtropical waters (Atlantic Ocean – eastern central, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, western central; Indian Ocean – eastern, western; Mediterranean Sea; Pacific Ocean – eastern central, northwest, southwest, western central). Green turtles are highly migratory and they undertake complex movements and migrations through geographically disparate habitats. Nesting occurs in more than 80 countries worldwide (Hirth 1997). Their movements within the marine environment are less understood but it is believed that green turtles inhabit coastal waters of over 140 countries (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).",,Terrestrial|Marine,"Green turtles have been afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (e.g., Navid 1982, Humphrey and Salm 1996, Fleming 2001, Fretey 2001). Among the more globally relevant designations are those of Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN; Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Hilton-Taylor 2000); Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Speciesof Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A partial list of the International Instruments that benefit green turtles includes the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA), the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection, the Memorandum of Agreement on the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa. <br/>As a result of these designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. The lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived green turtles.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Analyses of subpopulation changes at 25 Index Sites distributed globally (see W-Figure 1 in Supplementary Material) show an 84 to 87% decline in number of mature females nesting annually over the last 3 Hawksbill generations (see W-Table 1 in Supplementary Material). Numerous populations, especially some of the larger ones, have continued to decline since the last assessment of the species (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Today, some protected populations are stable or increasing, but the overall decline of the species, when considered within the context of three generations, has been in excess of 80%.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Assessment Procedure</span>:<br/>In accord with the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, the Hawksbill is listed as Critically Endangered (CR A2bd) because it meets the following criteria:<br/><br/>A.&#160; Reduction in population size based on:<br/><br/>2.&#160;&#160;&#160; An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of 80% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, where the reduction or its causes may not have ceased OR may not be understood OR may not be reversible, based on (and specifying):<br/><br/>(b)&#160;&#160;&#160; an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon; and<br/><br/>(d)&#160;&#160; actual or potential levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>This assessment measures changes in populations based on the number of mature individuals (IUCN 2001a), specifically changes in the annual number of nesting females.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Index Sites</span>:<br/>Choice of Index Sites.&#160; Reliable historic data are not available for all subpopulations, so the present report quantifies population trends by examining data from 25 Index Sites (see W-Figure 1, IND-Table 1, PAC-Table 1 and ATL-Table 1 in Supplementary Material). Index Sites were chosen to represent broad regional subpopulation trends over time and include representative major nesting areas as well as many of the lesser nesting areas for which quantitative data are available. An estimated 41% of the current global population of nesting females is represented by index sites.<br/><br/>The most reliable method of monitoring trends in sea turtle populations are long-term population assessments conducted at the nesting beach (Meylan 1982) and these are used as an appropriate index of abundance for the taxon (IUCN 2001a, 2001b). But, estimating the total number of adult females in a nesting population is complicated by the fact that an individual female typically nests several times within a breeding season, and follows a non-annual breeding schedule, with intervals of two to seven years separating consecutive nesting seasons. Individuals also may be reproductively active for decades (Carr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978, FitzSimmons et al. 1995, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Long-term monitoring is thus essential to document true population change.&#160;&#160; Few long-term studies of nesting Hawksbills exist, in part because sea turtle research did not become popular until the 1970s, and by then many populations had already been reduced to low levels (Meylan 1999).<br/><br/>Interpretation of long-term data can be complicated.&#160; Because Hawksbills mature slowly, an over-exploited nesting population may already be in decline for decades before the damage manifests itself as a decrease in numbers of nesting turtles on the nesting beach.&#160; Meanwhile, documented increases in numbers of nesting females must be interpreted cautiously, as they do not always reflect an absolute increase in the size of the population. In situations where protection is afforded a breeding population that previously had been subject to intense exploitation, numbers of egg clutches laid are likely to rise precipitously at the newly protected rookery.&#160; This is because, with protection, individual females survive not only to lay their full complement of three to five egg clutches within a single nesting season, but also return to breed in subsequent seasons. <br/>&#160;<br/>Because of the extended and complicated life cycle of the Hawksbill, to quantify only a single stage in the life cycle will not always adequately portray the true status of the entire population.&#160; For example, where over-exploitation of nesting females or eggs has impeded reproduction during long periods of time, estimates of population decline based only on numbers of nests may significantly underestimate the overall population decline at those sites because they will not reflect the absence of juvenile foraging turtles in the wider population (Mortimer 1995).&#160; Although studies on foraging grounds are useful, reliable quantitative data on the size of foraging populations, and especially historical data describing foraging populations, are generally not available.&#160; Interpretation of foraging data is further confounded by the mixing of animals from various nesting populations at the foraging grounds (Broderick <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1994, Encalada <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996). Similarly, recent increases on some Caribbean nesting beaches demonstrate the difficulty in predicting increasing numbers of sea turtles.&#160; Although reduced effort in the Cuban Hawksbill fishery has spared more than 55,000 large animals on its foraging grounds since the early 1990s (Mortimer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), to date regional nesting increases are still relatively small. <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Data Sources for Index Sites</span>. To assess long term changes in the nesting populations at each of the 25 Index Sites, we used several types of data sources, often in combination with each other.&#160; For sites for which data on annual numbers of nesting females are not available we used other indices of nesting abundance, including numbers of nests recorded, numbers of nesting females killed, numbers of nesting females recorded per unit of patrol effort, and numbers of egg clutches collected for human consumption or for incubation in hatcheries. At some sites, different measures of Hawksbill abundance were used, including tortoiseshell export statistics, and total numbers of slaughtered animals (including both nesting and foraging turtles). The data were derived from a multitude of sources, including published scientific and historical literature and unpublished reports. We are grateful to the numerous researchers, especially the members of the MTSG Hawksbill Task Force, who generously provided their unpublished data and the benefit of their personal experience to ensure that the most up-to-date information be included in this assessment (see Acknowledgements in the Supplementary Material). As noted in the text and accompanying tables, such information is recorded as in lit. citations. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, for sea turtles and other long-lived species, decades of long-term quantitative data are seldom available. Few Hawksbill nest-monitoring projects were carried out in the 20th century on populations that are now depleted or remnants of their former size (Meylan 1999). Nevertheless, to estimate changes in populations over time, the contributions of historically large, but now depleted, populations needs to be considered.&#160; Where quantitative data are lacking, old naturalist’s records, historic egg collection data, and tortoise shell trade statistics are often the best source of information about populations, and can be used to estimate former abundance and subsequent declines.&#160; Unfortunately, while some excellent information about the enormous trade in tortoiseshell is available, in many areas of the world researchers will never know the full extent of the Hawksbill declines that have taken place before and during the 20th century. For example, Hawksbills were likely found in some numbers along the eastern coasts of the Pacific and Atlantic although now they have become scarce.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Extrapolated Data For Index Sites</span>.&#160; In the present assessment, where quantitative data are available, population abundance estimates are based on raw data, and linear and exponential extrapolation functions (IUCN 2001a). In some subpopulations, more than one trajectory was exhibited over the 3-generation interval; changes in subpopulation size are thus often based on a combination of raw data and extrapolations. If no change is believed to have occurred outside the time interval for which published abundance data are available, we use the raw data to determine the change in population size. However, when it appeared that change in subpopulation abundance occurred outside the interval for which raw data were available, we used extrapolation techniques to determine the overall change. Linear extrapolations were used when it was believed that the same amount of change occurred each year, irrespective of total subpopulation size. Exponential extrapolations were used when it was believed that change was proportional to the subpopulation size. In cases where there is a lack of information on the specific rate of change, we used both linear and exponential extrapolations to derive a population estimate. However, when either the linear or exponential function produced an obviously unrealistic number, we included the unrealistic figures in the tables summarizing estimated population change over three generations (and noted them as being unrealistic), but we did not use those unrealistic figures to estimate population changes for the ocean basin under consideration (see IND-Table 3, PAC-Table 3, and ATL-Table 3 in Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">Backward Extrapolations of Increasing Populations</span>.&#160; Significant increases in nesting populations during the past two decades have been recorded at a number of nesting localities, particularly in the Atlantic Ocean at the following Index Sites:&#160; Antigua (Jumby Bay), Barbados, Cuba (Doce Leguas Cays), Mexico (Yucatan Peninsula), Puerto Rico (Mona Island), and US Virgin Islands (Buck Island Reef National Monument). The observed population increases correlate with implementation of protective measures at these nesting sites in combination with decreased exploitation at neighbouring foraging grounds (especially in Cuba).&#160; However, most of these now-increasing populations were not monitored prior to implementation of protective measures (the presence of researchers on the beach is often a significant element of the actual protection afforded such sites). <br/><br/>Using only the raw data available for these now-increasing sites, it would be impossible to estimate the overall rate of population change during the past three turtle generations, since in most cases data for the protected sites are only available from the mid-1980s onward. There is no reason to doubt that these increasing populations had suffered the same sort of declines as other nesting populations in the region for which earlier data exist. Rather than eliminate these populations from the summary calculations for the ocean basin (and over-estimate the rate of decline), we incorporated these data by extrapolating backwards from 1985, using the average population trajectory calculated for all the other Index Sites in the region for which there are data prior to 1985. The results of these calculations are presented in ATL-Table 6 (in Supplementary Material).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Qualitative Information</span><br/>Numerical historic rates of change in the sizes of nesting populations at the Index Sites describe only one aspect of the global conservation status of the Hawksbill turtle, and tend to be somewhat biased towards those subpopulations for which long-term quantitative data exist.&#160; A wealth of information also exists about the current status of many of the world's Hawksbill nesting populations, as well as the various modern-day factors, both positive and negative, affecting them.&#160; These include:&#160; a) the residual impacts from long-term tortoiseshell trade;&#160; b) current levels of purposeful slaughter and egg collection;&#160;&#160; c) incidental capture in fishing gear; d) destruction of nesting beaches caused by unregulated coastal development, oil pollution, sea level rise and accompanying erosional processes, and elevated incubation temperatures;&#160; e)&#160; damage to foraging habitat caused by sea water warming, and pollution;&#160; and&#160; f) efforts to raise awareness, and to coordinate and legislate protection.&#160; Such information is critical to a complete understanding of the current status of Hawksbill populations around the world. <br/><br/>For 58 countries around the world we have compiled information on current estimated population sizes and qualitative information about current trends in nesting and foraging populations, and the factors influencing them either positively or negatively (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material)&#160; The inclusion of such relatively qualitative information ensures that even those countries with the fewest resources for monitoring and enforcement can be represented in this assessment; and these areas are often the ones where greatest exploitation and declines have occurred (IUCN 2001b).&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncertainties in the Assessment Process</span><br/>As with any assessment based on historic data or small data sets, there is uncertainty relating to the final results of this report. The sources of uncertainty are rooted in the procedure itself as well as in the stochastic nature of Hawksbill biology. Both sources of uncertainty are ultimately related to a lack of information, and when dealing with an animal as long-lived as a Hawksbill, this can be a particularly acute problem. <br/><br/>Since the last Hawksbill assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999), the IUCN Standarads and Petitions Working Group have developed a system of regression equations to address population changes over time and produce estimates of previous population sizes. With care to filter out overly regressed populations, this system appears to be adequate. Scale of population change needs to be cautiously addressed: on the one hand, declines can go no lower than 100%, but potential population increases are limitless. Small population declines that may be difficult to observe annually can be devastating over several generations.&#160; For example, a hypothetical Hawksbill population numbering 1,000 females declining at a steady rate of 1% annually would have declined by 50% in only 68 years and by 75% in 135 years.&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>Another issue of concern is the fact that most of the increasing nesting populations in the Caribbean were included as Index Sites in this assessment, while many declining populations were not included due to lack of data. At many sites, the simple process of monitoring a population offers significant protection. Meanwhile, adjacent unprotected and unmonitored nesting sites may be suffering significant decline due to poaching and destruction of nesting habitat that are unrecorded. A case in point is that of Antigua/Barbuda, where the relatively small Jumby Bay nesting population, which has been intensely monitored since 1987, has increased by 79% (+23 turtles) during the past two decades. Meanwhile, the other 35 known Hawksbill nesting beaches of Antigua/ Barbuda neither have been afforded protection, nor has the status of their nesting populations been monitored (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; We are concerned that in the Atlantic Ocean, protected populations are over-represented in our assessment, thus causing the assessment to under-estimate the true rate of regional population decline. <br/><br/>Seychelles, in the Indian Ocean, is one of the few places in the world where records of long-term monitoring of both protected and unprotected beaches are available (see IND-Table 4 in Supplementary Material).&#160; For the inner islands of Seychelles, monitoring was conducted at all 22 islands during both the early 1980s and the early 2000s. Nesting populations at the two islands that had been well-protected since the 1970s increased by 389% during a period of two decades; meanwhile, the nesting populations at 13 islands that had received no protection prior to 1994 declined by 59% during the same period.&#160; When all 22 of the inner islands are considered together, there was an overall decline of 24% in the total nesting population between the early 1980s and the early 2000s.","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Hawksbills nest on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Witzell 1983). Available data indicate that newly emerged hatchlings enter the sea and are carried by offshore currents into major gyre systems where they remain until reaching a carapace length of some 20 to 30 cm. At that point they recruit into a neritic developmental foraging habitat that may comprise coral reefs or other hard bottom habitats, sea grass, algal beds, or mangrove bays and creeks (Musick and Limpus 1997) or mud flats (R. von Brandis unpubl. data). As they increase in size, immature Hawksbills typically inhabit a series of developmental habitats, with some tendency for larger turtles to inhabit deeper sites (van Dam and Diez 1997, Bowen et al. 2007). Once sexually mature, they undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and breeding areas at intervals of several years (Witzell 1983, Dobbs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Global population genetic studies have demonstrated the tendency of female sea turtles to return to breed at their natal rookery (Bowen and Karl 1997), even though as juveniles they may have foraged at developmental habitats located hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the natal beach. While Hawksbills undertake long migrations, some portion of immature animals may settle into foraging habitats near their beaches of origin (Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Roles in the Ecosystem&#160; </span><br/>Like other species of sea turtles, Hawksbills contribute to marine and coastal food webs and transport nutrients within the oceans (Bouchard and Bjorndal 2000). Hawksbills are important components of healthy coral reef ecosystems and are primarily spongivorous in the Caribbean (Meylan 1988), but more omnivorous in the Indo-Pacific (review by Bjorndal 1997). They consume relatively large amounts of algae in northern Australia (Whiting 2000 cited in S. Whiting in litt. to J. Mortimer 4 Jun 2007), soft corals in the Great Barrier Reef region (C. Limpus unpublished data), and other combinations of forage depending on habitat (in Seychelles, J. Mortimer and R. von Brandis unpublished data; in Barbados, B. Krueger unpublished data). At sites where they are primarily spongivorous, Hawksbills have been found to support healthy reefs by controlling sponges which would otherwise out-compete reef-building corals for space (Hill 1998, León and Bjorndal 2002, Bjorndal and Jackson 2003).","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Threats</span>: <br/><br/>The most important threats to Hawksbill turtles, described here, are dealt with in greater detail in the section entitled Regional Overview (see Supplementary Material).<br/><ul><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Tortoiseshell Trade</span>. Recent and historical tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Within the last 100 years, millions of Hawksbills have been killed for the tortoiseshell markets of Europe, the United States and Asia. The global plight of the Hawksbill in the latter half of the 20th Century has been recognized by the inclusion of the species in the most threatened category of IUCN’s Red List since 1968 and the listing of all Hawksbill populations on Appendix I of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, since 1977. Nevertheless, trade continued at exceptionally high levels for years as major trading countries acceded to CITES and Japan, the world’s largest consumer of bekko (tortoiseshell), continued to import shell under a CITES reservation (exception) until 1993. During the period 1950-1992, Japan’s bekko imports were the equivalent of 1,329,044 large turtles (1,408,787 kg). Conservatively estimating that 30% of the turtles taken for the trade were nesting females, nearly 400,000 adult female Hawksbills were killed for the Japanese market in those years, a time frame that approximates a single Hawksbill generation. Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products continues to be a major problem in many countries and, despite international and domestic prohibitions and the lessening of the volume in the last decade, trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas and southeast Asia (Fleming 2001, Chacón 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Egg Collection</span>. Intense levels of egg exploitation continue in many parts of the world (see IND-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material), especially southeast Asia, where it approaches 100% in many areas (see PAC-Tables 4 and 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Slaughter for Meat</span>. Adult and juvenile Hawksbills are still killed for meat in many areas (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).&#160; In some places the meat is used by fishermen as shark bait (J. Mortimer unpubl. data, C. Lagueux, unpubl. data). Fishermen who target lobster and reef fish will commonly take whatever hawksbills they encounter (Carr and Meylan 1980).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Destruction of Nesting Habitat</span>. Tropical coastlines are rapidly being developed for tourism which often leads to destruction of nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material). Because Hawksbills prefer to nest under vegetation they are particularly impacted by beach-front development and clearing of dune vegetation. Daytime nesting Hawksbills in the Western Indian Ocean are particular sensitive to disturbance from human activity on the coast and in nearshore waters (Mortimer 2004). In other parts of the world such as the Middle East and Western Australia gas and oil refineries seriously disrupt nesting habitat (see IND-Table 5 and PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Destruction of Foraging Habitat</span>. Hawksbills are typically associated with coral reefs, which are among the world’s most endangered marine ecosystems (Wilkinson 2000). Climate change has led to massive coral bleaching events with permanent consequences for local habitats (Sheppard 2006) (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Hybridisation of Hawksbills with Other Species</span>. At certain sites where Hawksbill numbers are particularly low, they regularly hybridise with other species of sea turtles (see ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Entanglement and Ingestion of Marine Debris - including Fishing Gear</span>. Hawkbills are particularly susceptible to entanglement in gill nets (see IND-Table 5, PAC-Table 5 and ATL-Table 7 in Supplementary Material) and capture on fishing hooks (Mortimer 1998). Juvenile Hawksbills comprised 47% of all turtles entangled in derelict fishing nets and other debris in northern Australian waters (Kiessling 2003, White 2004). Ingestion of marine debris by Hawksbills is also significant (White 2004).</li><li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Oil Pollution</span>. There is evidence oil pollution has a greater impact on Hawksbills than on other species of turtle (Meylan and Redlow 2006). In some parts of the world (especially the Middle East) oil pollution is a major problem (see IND-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).<br/></li></ul><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;""><br/>Tortoiseshell Trade Overview</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">History of the Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as “one of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the trade” (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).<br/><br/>The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the world’s tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the world’s most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the region’s Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).<br/><br/>European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo et al. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20th Century Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world.&#160; In the early 20th Century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was “an established industry in almost every civilized country” (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of “wanton destruction” in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, Japan was the world’s largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; </span><br/>In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force. By 1977 the entire species was moved to Appendix I to prohibit all international trade. Nevertheless, the global trade continued for a number of years, in large part driven by Japanese demand. At the end of 1992, Japanese imports ceased, but the industry continues to operate with stockpiled material.<br/><ul><li>In the late 1970s more than 45 countries were involved in exporting and importing raw shell, with annual Japanese imports the equivalent of about 37,700 turtles (40,000 kg).</li><li>Export and import levels remained exceptionally high until the mid-1980s as major trading nations slowly joined CITES. When they acceded to CITES in 1978, France and Italy took reservations (exceptions) to the Appendix I Hawksbill listing; these reservations were withdrawn in 1984 when they joined the EU.</li><li>When Japan acceded to CITES in 1980, it also took a reservation on the Hawksbill and reduced its annual quota to the equivalent of 28,300 turtles (30,000 kg), based solely on the needs of its bekko industry.</li><li>In 1985 CITES proposals by Indonesia and the Seychelles to place their Hawksbill populations on Appendix II to allow trade failed at the 5th CITES Conference of the Parties (COP 5). A similar Indonesian proposal at COP 6 in 1987 was withdrawn before the vote.</li><li>A comprehensive report on the Japanese sea turtle trade by Milliken and Tokunaga in 1987 documented significant amounts of bekko trade with CITES countries. From 1980 to 1985, between 42% and 58% of all bekko imports originated in CITES countries, without proper export documents.</li><li>In 1989 a detailed report commissioned by the CITES Secretariat found that Hawksbill populations were depleted or declining in 56 of 65 geopolitical units for which data were available and estimated that the annual global nesting population was a minimum of 15,000-25,000 Hawksbills. The authors concluded that the listing of the species on Appendix I was “unquestionably appropriate and must be maintained” (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989).</li><li>On 1 April 1990, Japan reduced its annual bekko quota to the equivalent of 18,870 turtles (20,000 kg,).&#160; In 1991, in an effort to avoid a U.S. embargo of its fish and fishery products, Japan agreed to further reduce its annual quota to the equivalent of 7,075 turtles (7,500 kg) by August 1991, to establish a zero quota on 1 January 1993, and to drop its Hawksbill reservation in July 1994. Japan also agreed to support the re-training of hundreds of bekko artisans. In the early 1990s, in response to the end of the Japanese trade, Cuba reduced its annual Hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 turtles to 500.</li><li>Since 1994, officials in Seychelles and Zanzibar have acquired tortoiseshell stocks from local artisans and subsequently burned them to demonstrate a commitment to ending the tortoiseshell trade (Khatib et al. 1996, Mortimer 1999). Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).</li><li>In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.</li><li>In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.</li><li>Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hhawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.</li><li>In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Japanese Tortoiseshell Trade</span><br/>Twenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japan’s sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.<br/><br/>Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%)</span>: 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan. Panama hosted the region’s largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century. After 1961, Hawksbills in the Cuban trade were captured only at sea, but comprised adult and large immature animals.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asia (20.8%)</span>: nine countries provided the shell of 387,020 turtles (290,265 kg). Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg). Asia was nearly the sole source of Japan’s stuffed juvenile Hawksbill imports, as discussed below.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">North America (15.1%)</span>: the United States provided Japan with the shell of 199,490 turtles (211,463 kg) in two very large shipments, 142,241 kg in 1951 and 68,402 in 1954. The countries of origin are unknown, but in all likelihood some quantity originated in U.S. Caribbean and Pacific territories.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean and East Africa (8.7%)</span>: 15 countries provided the shell of 164,828 turtles (121,973 kg). Kenya and Tanzania, regional collection points, were the major exporters. Countries in the northwestern Indian Ocean are notably absent from Japanese import statistics. As a non-CITES country, Maldives figured prominently in the trade after 1984 despite its national legislation protecting Hawksbills. Japanese imports therefore were in contravention of CITES Conf. Res. 4.25, which requires a nation with a reservation to treat an Appendix I species as Appendix II, with valid export documents from the country of origin.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Oceania (5.8%)</span>: six countries provided the shell of 92,124 turtles (81,069 kg). A significant proportion of this trade is attributed to Australia until 1977 (29,109 turtles; 25,616 kg). Solomon Islands and Fiji were also important suppliers, especially in the final years of trading, with 40,982 and 14,490 turtles (36,064 and 12,751 kg, respectively). Fiji banned all tortoiseshell exports in January 1991 (Daly, 1991) but domestic tourist trade in Hawksbill curios and whole carapaces continues (see PAC-Table 5 in Supplementary Material).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Europe and West Africa (5.4%)</span>: 10 countries provided the shell of 70,560 turtles (74,793 kg). The Netherlands was the largest exporter with the equivalent of 44,775 turtles (47,461 kg), but the source of this shell is unknown.</li><li>In the 1970s, small lacquered Hawksbills became popular in Japan as symbols of long life. From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).</li><li>Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japan’s trade under its CITES reservation. These included imports of shell from non-CITES countries that did not legally allow export of shell, as well as imports from countries known to have had too few turtles to supply the shell attributed to them. Based on these data, Japanese bekko imports from 11 of the 14 countries reported by the dealers in 1989 were illegal.</li><li>The bekko stockpile in Japan includes raw shell and finished products. After Japan banned all imports in January 1993, annual Japanese domestic sales from stockpiled supplies remained high. Between July 1995 and July 1998 the stockpile was reduced from 188.4 to 102.73 tonnes (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000). Information on subsequent annual sales and use is not available, but supplies would now be exhausted if utilization had continued at 28 tonnes a year after July 1998.</li><li>Today, however, the bekko industry is intact, and Japanese consumer demand remains high. In January 2000, the valuable raw shell from abdominal plates ranged in price from JPY 30,000 per kg to JPY 150,000 per kg (US $ 294-$1470 at that time) (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">21st Century Global Trade</span><br/>Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products is a major problem in many countries and, despite prohibitions on international trade and a reduction in its volume in the last decade, international and domestic trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas, Asia, and parts of Africa (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).<br/><ul><li>Some Japanese dealers have continued to import shell illegally as evidenced by numerous bekko shipments intercepted en route to or in Japan since the ban took effect (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000) and ongoing underground trade in southeast Asia to Japan and other destinations (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004).</li><li>More than a decade after the Japanese prohibition on bekko imports took effect, van Dijk and Shepherd (2004) reported the interest of the Japan Bekko Association in acquiring Indonesia’s remaining stockpiles of bekko.</li><li>Although the volume of trade in Indonesia diminished significantly between 1991 and 2001, it is still substantial. The collection of tortoiseshell still occurs in numerous places, with most of the trade appearing to be disorganized and underground. Western Sumatra, Nias, and Papua are areas where significant exploitation and trade are known or suspected (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).</li><li>Those familiar with the trade warn that Indonesian stockpiles should be seized “as any indication of resumption of international trade of bekko could lead to requests from Indonesian traders to be allowed to sell their stockpiles” (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).</li><li>Surveys in Viet Nam in 2002 revealed an active international trade in tortoiseshell that had increased since 1999.&#160; Shell was purchased by tourists and foreigners buying in bulk for export to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), Thailand, China and Asian communities in North America and Europe. Viet Nam subsequently instituted full protection for the Hawksbill (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC East Asia 2004).</li><li>In recent reviews of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, researchers provided evidence of extensive clandestine trade in sea turtles, including Hawksbills.&#160; Management and law enforcement are inadequate throughout the region (Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).</li><li>On 1 February 2007, the Kyodo News of Japan reported that Cuba would not seek to re-open the international tortoiseshell trade at the upcoming CITES meeting and noted Japanese disappointment given the long term support provided for the bekko industry. During 1991-2006, the Japanese government spent 735 million yen (US $6M) for research on Hawksbill resources and 140 million yen (US $1.1M) for projects to resume international trade, including trade with Cuba. The article also reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will support the bekko industry for another five years.<span times="""" new="""" roman=""""></li></ul>","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Generation Length</span><br/>Generation length is defined as the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (Pianka 1974). Hawksbills mature very slowly, taking 20 to 40 years, and so are long-lived (Chaloupka and Musick 1997). In the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, Hawksbills may mature in 20 or more years (Boulon 1983, 1994; Diez and van Dam 2002; Krueger in litt. 2006). Age to maturity in the Indo-Pacific requires a minimum of 30-35 years (Limpus 1992; Limpus and Miller 2000; Mortimer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2003). In northeastern Australia, first breeding is estimated to occur at 31-36 years for females and 38 years for males (Limpus and Miller 2000).<br/><br/>Data on reproductive longevity in Hawksbills are limited, but becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches.&#160; During the last decade, numerous individual Caribbean Hawksbills have been recorded actively nesting over a period of 14-22 years (C.E. Diez in litt. 2006, Z. Hillis-Starr in litt. 2006, Parrish and Goodman 2006). In the Indo-Pacific&#160; Mortimer and Bresson (1999) and Limpus (1992) have reported nesting over 17-20 years, comparable to other Chelonid turtles which range from 20 to 30 years (Carr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978, FitzSimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995).<br/><br/>Given estimated ages to maturity of 25 years in the Caribbean and 35 years in the Indo-Pacific, with half of reproductive longevity estimated at 10 years, a conservative generation length of 35 years (25 + 10 years) is calculated for the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, and 45 years (35 + 10 years) in the Indo-Pacific. In analyzing the data, declines over three generations are therefore measured for up to 105 years in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic and up to 135 years in the Indo-Pacific. In fact, generation length may well have been longer in the days when population density was higher (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nesting Population Size and Fecundity</span><br/>Sea turtle population trends are best diagnosed using in-water abundance estimates coupled with estimates of demographic parameters such as survival and recruitment possibilities (Chaloupka and Limpus 2001, Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). However, these data rarely exist for sea turtle populations and so most assessments are based on evaluating nesting trends, which assumes a close correlation between population trends and nesting activity (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/>&#160;<br/>For this assessment the size of a nesting population is defined as the average number of individual females nesting per year. In some cases, population numbers can be determined by saturation tagging of nesting females or by recording the total number of slaughtered nesters. More often, however, population estimates need to be derived from records of the total number of egg clutches laid during a season. Saturation tagging of nesting females indicates that at most sites the average female Hawksbill lays between three and five egg clutches during a single nesting season (Richardson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999), with indications that newly recruited females lay fewer egg clutches (Mortimer and Bresson 1999, Beggs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), and possibly fewer clutches in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (Pilcher 1999). Following the pattern of earlier status reviews, the present assessment calculates the annual number of nesting females by dividing the total number of egg clutches recorded, by three to five to produce a bracketed population estimate.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population Trends and Conclusions</span><br/>In many parts of the world, Hawksbill populations have continued to decline since the publication of the previous Red List Assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Continuing losses in southeast Asia are of particular concern. Hawksbills face multiple, severe threats. The volume of the tortoiseshell trade has diminished, yet it remains active and substantial, and the Japanese bekko industry remains intact.<br/><br/>In 2001 the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee upheld the Critically Endangered listing of the Hawksbill, based on ongoing and long-term declines in excess of 80% within the time frame of three generations and ongoing exploitation (IUCN 2001b). The Subcommittee review cited “convincing evidence of reductions in excess of 80% over the last three generations at many, if not most of the important breeding sites throughout the global range of the species”. Not surprisingly, those declines reflect the intensity of the tortoiseshell trade in the 20th Century. Although some relatively large populations still exist, especially in Australia, this is not inconsistent with long-term global or even regional population reduction over three generations (a point noted by the Subcommittee). Unlike previous reviews of the status of the Hawksbill, the present assessment is quantitative and provides a numerical basis for the global listing of the species as Critically Endangered. The 2001 findings of the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee are as valid today as they were six years ago.<br/><br/>The current assessment clearly demonstrates the importance of protection in both terrestrial and marine habitats. With protection, some populations have stabilized, and others are now increasing, most notably in the Caribbean. The increases documented in the Caribbean coincide with dramatic reductions in take on the foraging grounds of Cuba which have, in effect, spared tens of thousands of large Hawksbills since the early 1990s. Such increases provide hope for the future, but unfortunately are still the exception rather than the rule. Similar results are needed elsewhere.",Decreasing,"<p>The Hawksbill has a circumglobal distribution throughout tropical and, to a lesser extent, subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. Hawksbills are migratory and individuals undertake complex movements through geographically disparate habitats during their lifetimes. Hawksbill nesting occurs in at least 70 countries, although much of it now only at low densities. Their movements within the marine environment are less understood, but Hawksbills are believed to inhabit coastal waters in more than 108 countries (Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989, Baillie and Groombridge 1996; see Regional Overviews in Supplementary Material).</p>","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Tortoiseshell Trade Overview</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">History of the Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell, the beautiful scutes of the carapace and plastron of the Hawksbill turtle, has been prized since ancient times. Surrounded by legend, tortoiseshell has been described as “one of the romantic articles of commerce, not only because of where it comes from, but because of the creatures from which it is obtained and the people engaged in the trade” (quoted in Parsons 1972). Jewellery and other tortoiseshell objects have been unearthed from pre-dynastic graves of the Nubian rulers of Egypt and excavated from the ruins of the Han Empire which ruled China in pre-Christian times. Over 2,000 years ago Julius Caesar considered the warehouses of Alexandria brimming with tortoiseshell to be the chief spoil of his triumph. By the early years of the 9th Century, caravans of Arab traders carried rhinoceros horn, ivory, and tortoiseshell throughout the Indian Ocean. For the next 1,000 years, the tortoiseshell trade flourished (Parsons 1972). Around 1700, during the Edo Period, the bekko (tortoiseshell) artisans of Japan established themselves at Nagasaki (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987).&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><br/>The tortoiseshell trade has been closely linked to European discovery, conquest, and commerce around the world. The Portuguese, Dutch, French and English played major roles in the global trade; exploitation occurred throughout the world’s tropical oceans, and especially in the East Indies (i.e., modern day India, Indo China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The East Indies were a major source of the shell of antiquity, and these rich waters fittingly have been called the world’s most productive seas for tortoiseshell (Parsons 1972). In the insular Pacific international trade did not develop until the mid 19th Century, but once established, it took a tremendous toll on the region’s Hawksbills. For the next 150 years, tortoiseshell was a prized commodity in the Pacific, first with the sandal-wooders and then with the whalers (McKinnon 1975).<br/><br/>European Hawksbill fishing in the Caribbean began in the mid-17th Century and intensified throughout the 18th Century as demand increased (McClenachan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). As they decimated local Hawksbill populations in one area after another, turtle fishermen moved from one site to the next. The plentiful Hawksbill resources of Central America were exploited for more than 100 years by traders, including Americans, who established the town of Bocas del Toro on the coast of Panama in 1826 (Parsons 1972). Turtling was still a lucrative business in Cuba in 1885 when the village of Cocodrilos on the Isle of Pines was settled by turtle fishermen who emigrated from the Cayman Islands after its Hawksbills were gone (Carrillo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999). Over the next 100 years, many tens of thousands of Hawksbills were captured in the rich foraging grounds of the Cuban shelf.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">20th Century Trade</span><br/>Tortoiseshell trade statistics are key to understanding the enormous and enduring effect that trade has had on Hawksbill populations around the world. In the early 20th century, tortoiseshell was imported for luxury markets in Europe, the United States and Asia as the manufacture of combs and brushes, jewellery boxes, and tortoiseshell ornaments was “an established industry in almost every civilized country” (Seale 1917). Declines in Hawksbill populations were obvious in many areas by the first part of the century, as exemplified by expressions of “wanton destruction” in the Virgin Islands (Schmidt 1916) and over exploitation in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) (Dammerman 1929). Although existing records document an extensive trade in many countries, such as the 8,000 Hawksbills (8,000 kg) taken annually in the Philippines for the shell trade to Japan during World War I (Seale 1917) and 160,700 Hawksbills killed between 1918-1927 in the Dutch East Indies for export to Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands (Dammerman 1929), records for many other areas are incomplete.<br/><br/>During the 20th century, Japan was the world’s largest importer of tortoiseshell (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Although data are not available for imports in the first half of the century, Japanese statistics document the import of shell equivalent to more than 1.3 million large Hawksbills from around the world between 1950-1992 and more than 575,000 stuffed juveniles from Asia between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga 1987, Groombridge and Luxmoore 1989). Local trade in stuffed Hawksbills also flourished in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Americas, especially in tourist areas. When Japanese, European, American and other Asian imports are considered along with the large quantities of tortoiseshell used locally in places like Sri Lanka and Madagascar, it is readily apparent that some millions of Hawksbills were killed for the tortoiseshell trade in the last 100 years.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hawksbills and CITES&#160;&#160; </span><br/>In 1975, in recognition of its threatened status, the Hawksbill was included on Appendices I (Atlantic population) and II (Pacific population) of CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, when the Convention came into force.

Cape Verde has shown similar commitment (Fretey et al. 2002).</li><li>In 1997 and 2000, at CITES COP 10 and COP 11, Cuba proposed to sell its stockpiled tortoiseshell to Japan, and also proposed a continuation of the international trade in tortoiseshell taken from the 500 Hawksbills still captured each year. All these proposals failed.</li><li>In response to regional disagreement generated by Cuban interest in moving Caribbean Hawksbills from Appendix I to II, the CITES Secretariat convened two regional Hawksbill dialogues in 2001 and 2002. The Dialogues encouraged regional cooperation by helping to establish Hawksbill priorities. As a result, resources for research, management and conservation have been generated.</li><li>Although the tortoiseshell trade continues to threaten Hawksbills in numerous places, overall volume is substantially reduced. Thirty years after CITES came into force, the ban on international trade demonstrates its value over time in protecting Hawksbills. Above all, nesting increases in the Caribbean coincide with the enormous reduction in Hawksbill fishing in Cuban waters.</li><li>In June 2007, Cuba informed CITES COP 14 that it would voluntarily institute a moratorium on its sea turtle fisheries in 2008. Although Cuba has a CITES Hawksbill reservation (exception) and reserves its right to dispose of its tortoiseshell stockpile, most nations are members of CITES and therefore cannot legally trade in tortoiseshell.<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Japanese Tortoiseshell Trade</span><br/>Twenty years ago, in their landmark report on Japan’s sea turtle trade, Milliken and Tokunaga (1987) focused on providing estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills (and other species of sea turtles) represented by trade data so that the effect of Japanese exploitation around the world could be assessed. In particular, they cautioned that past exploitation is relevant to understanding and predicting current sea turtle population trends.<br/><br/>Estimates of the numbers of Hawksbills involved in the tortoiseshell trade are based on conversion factors calculated for each region by Milliken and Tokunaga (1987). Globally, the average Hawksbill produces 1.06 kg of tortoiseshell; but regionally, conversions are 0.74 kg in the Indian Ocean; 0.75 kg in Asia; 0.88 kg in Oceania; and 1.34 kg in the Caribbean. A combination of factors likely accounts for these differences, including regional variation in average adult size, as well as the relative proportion of adult and immature turtles represented in the trade. Some reports indicate that in the past the average turtle produced more shell than in recent decades. Adult turtles that survive long enough will continue to grow, so it follows that the average size of nesting animals tends to decline in an over-exploited population. In other cases, once nesting populations have been destroyed, hunters may shift their focus to foraging turtles which usually include immature animals. In the absence of specific historical information documenting the size classes of animals killed, the conversions we use in the present assessment are based on estimates provided by Milliken and Tokunaga. Based on the trade through 1992 (when legal Japanese imports ceased), the following information reveals the extent of the Japanese exploitation of global Hawksbill populations and the percent contribution of different regions to overall imports during 1950-1992.<br/><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Caribbean and Latin America (44.2%)</span>: 29 countries provided the shell of 460,220 turtles (616,695 kg). Exports from Panama and Cuba were the equivalent of 152,070 and 106,948 turtles (203,774 kg and 170,047 kg, respectively), making them the most important sources of bekko in the world for Japan. Panama hosted the region’s largest nesting Hawksbill assemblages until the latter part of the 20th Century. After 1961, Hawksbills in the Cuban trade were captured only at sea, but comprised adult and large immature animals.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Asia (20.8%)</span>: 9 countries provided the shell of 387,020 turtles (290,265 kg). Exports from Indonesia were the equivalent of 155,654 turtles (116,741 kg), making it the most important source in the region and the third largest global supplier to Japan. Much of the shell exported from Singapore to Japan was probably of Indonesian origin (118,535 turtles, 88,901 kg). Asia was nearly the sole source of Japan’s stuffed juvenile Hawksbill imports, as discussed below.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">North America (15.1%)</span>: the United States provided Japan with the shell of 199,490 turtles (211,463 kg) in two very large shipments, 142,241 kg in 1951 and 68,402 in 1954. The countries of origin are unknown, but in all likelihood some quantity originated in U.S. Caribbean and Pacific territories.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean and East Africa (8.7%)</span>: 15 countries provided the shell of 164,828 turtles (121,973 kg). Kenya and Tanzania, regional collection points, were the major exporters. Countries in the northwestern Indian Ocean are notably absent from Japanese import statistics. As a non-CITES country, Maldives figured prominently in the trade after 1984 despite its national legislation protecting Hawksbills. Japanese imports therefore were in contravention of CITES Conf. Res. 4.25, which requires a nation with a reservation to treat an Appendix I species as Appendix II, with valid export documents from the country of origin.</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Oceania (5.8%)</span>: six countries provided the shell of 92,124 turtles (81,069 kg). A significant proportion of this trade is attributed to Australia until 1977 (29,109 turtles; 25,616 kg).&#160; Solomon Islands and Fiji were also important suppliers, especially in the final years of trading, with 40,982 and 14,490 turtles (36,064 and 12,751 kg, respectively). Fiji banned all tortoiseshell exports in January 1991 (Daly, 1991) but domestic tourist trade in Hawksbill curios and whole carapaces continues (see PAC-Table 5 in attached PDF; see link below).</li><li><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Europe and West Africa (5.4%)</span>: 10 countries provided the shell of 70,560 turtles (74,793 kg). The Netherlands was the largest exporter with the equivalent of 44,775 turtles (47,461 kg), but the source of this shell is unknown.</li><li>In the 1970s, small lacquered Hawksbills became popular in Japan as symbols of long life. From 1970-1986 Japan imported 576,702 juvenile Hawksbills, mostly from Indonesia and Singapore but also from Taiwan, Province of China (32,075), the Ryukyus (13,438), Philippines (8698), Viet Nam (1195), Hong Kong (3549), and small quantities from a handful of other nations. Japan subsequently prohibited the trade, but continued to allow dealers to sell stocks acquired before July 1994. In December 1999, the dealers reported that they had a total of 135 stuffed sea turtles (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).</li><li>Numerous irregularities in bekko imports occurred in the final years of Japan’s trade under its CITES reservation. These included imports of shell from non-CITES countries that did not legally allow export of shell, as well as imports from countries known to have had too few turtles to supply the shell attributed to them. Based on these data, Japanese bekko imports from 11 of the 14 countries reported by the dealers in 1989 were illegal.</li><li>The bekko stockpile in Japan includes raw shell and finished products. After Japan banned all imports in January 1993, annual Japanese domestic sales from stockpiled supplies remained high. Between July 1995 and July 1998 the stockpile was reduced from 188.4 to 102.73 tonnes (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000). Information on subsequent annual sales and use is not available, but supplies would now be exhausted if utilization had continued at 28 tonnes a year after July 1998.</li><li>Today, however, the bekko industry is intact, and Japanese consumer demand remains high. In January 2000, the valuable raw shell from abdominal plates ranged in price from JPY 30,000 per kg to JPY 150,000 per kg (US $ 294-$1470 at that time) (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000).<br/></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">21st Century Global Trade</span><br/>Significant domestic trade in Hawksbill products is a major problem in many countries and, despite prohibitions on international trade and a reduction in its volume in the last decade, international and domestic trade remains an ongoing and pervasive threat in the Americas, Asia, and parts of Africa (Fleming 2001, Chacon 2002, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004, van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006). <br/><ul><li>Some Japanese dealers have continued to import shell illegally as evidenced by numerous bekko shipments intercepted en route to or in Japan since the ban took effect (TRAFFIC East Asia-Japan 2000) and ongoing underground trade in southeast Asia to Japan and other destinations (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 2004).</li><li>More than a decade after the Japanese prohibition on bekko imports took effect, van Dijk and Shepherd (2004) reported the interest of the Japan Bekko Association in acquiring Indonesia’s remaining stockpiles of bekko.</li><li>Although the volume of trade in Indonesia diminished significantly between 1991 and 2001, it is still substantial. The collection of tortoiseshell still occurs in numerous places, with most of the trade appearing to be disorganized and underground. Western Sumatra, Nias, and Papua are areas where significant exploitation and trade are known or suspected (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).</li><li>Those familiar with the trade warn that Indonesian stockpiles should be seized “as any indication of resumption of international trade of bekko could lead to requests from Indonesian traders to be allowed to sell their stockpiles” (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004).</li><li>Surveys in Viet Nam in 2002 revealed an active international trade in tortoiseshell that had increased since 1999. Shell was purchased by tourists and foreigners buying in bulk for export to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan (Province of China), Thailand, China and Asian communities in North America and Europe. Viet Nam subsequently instituted full protection for the Hawksbill (van Dijk and Shepherd 2004, TRAFFIC East Asia 2004).</li><li>In recent reviews of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican Republic, Central America, Colombia and Venezuela, researchers provided evidence of extensive clandestine trade in sea turtles, including Hawksbills.&#160; Management and law enforcement are inadequate throughout the region (Brautigam and Eckert 2006, Reuter and Allan 2006).</li><li>On 1 February 2007, the Kyodo News of Japan reported that Cuba would not seek to re-open the international tortoiseshell trade at the upcoming CITES meeting and noted Japanese disappointment given the long term support provided for the bekko industry. During 1991-2006, the Japanese government spent 735 million yen (US $6M) for research on Hawksbill resources and 140 million yen (US $1.1M) for projects to resume international trade, including trade with Cuba. The article also reported that the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry will support the bekko industry for another five years.<br/></li></ul>",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>The measures briefly described below are dealt with in greater detail in the Regional Overviews (see Supplementary Material).</p>  <ul><li><u><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">Treaties      and Agreements.</u><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">&#160; Hawksbills benefit globally      from inclusion in CITES, the Convention on International Trade in      Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (listed on Appendix I) and CMS,<strong>      </strong>the Convention on Migratory Species (listed on Appendices I and      II).&#160; Regional agreements also help to conserve Hawksbills and their      habitats (see Regional Summaries, Appendix II).</span></li><li><u><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">Public      Awareness.</u><strong><span times="""" new="""" roman=""""> </span></strong><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">&#160;Interest      in Hawksbills and other species of marine turtles is at an all-time high      around the world.&#160; Interest in ecotourism is growing.</li><li><u><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">Capacity      building.</span></u><strong><span times="""" new="""" roman=""""> &#160;</strong><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">Increasing      numbers of biologists and conservationists focusing on sea turtles around      the world<strong> </strong>benefit hawksbills.</span></li><li><u><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">Protected      Areas.</u><strong><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">&#160; </span></strong><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">Nesting      and foraging sanctuaries protect Hawksbills although effective enforcement      remains an elusive goal in many.</li><li><span times="""" new="""" roman=""""></span><u><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">Legislation and Enforcement.</u><strong><span times="""" new="""" roman="""">&#160; </span></strong>Numerous<strong> </strong>countries have temporarily or permanently banned all exploitation of sea turtles and their eggs and are attempting to improve enforcement of international bans on the tortoiseshell trade.</li></ul>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Available information indicates that the species has disappeared entirely from about 40% of its past range through a combination of habitat loss and exploitation, and that remaining populations have been severely depleted by recent and ongoing exploitation predominantly for domestic consumption; an overall population reduction of 80% over two past and one future generation is a conservative estimate, thus qualifying as Critically Endangered under criterion A4d. Population modelling indicates collapse and extinction in a period of on average 45 years into the future, thus meeting Critically Endangered under criterion E. Habitat loss rates approach or exceed 80% over the three generation period, thus A4c may also be met.","The Radiated Tortoise is found in low irregular rainfall areas with xerophytic spiny vegetation dominated by Didiereaceae and <em>Ephorbia</em> (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989). They can be found on the high plateaus inland and also on the sandy dunes close to the coast (Leuteritz <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Radiated Tortoises are herbivores feeding predominantly on grasses and in some areas on the alien invasive <em>Opuntia</em>. On occasion they are also known to ingest animal matter. During the rainy season wild tortoises drink from water that collects on rocks after it rains (Leuteritz 2003).<br/><br/>Adult female tortoises range in carapace length from 24.2 - 35.6 cm and males ranged in from 28.5 - 39.5 cm (Pedrono 2008). Males exhibit distinct secondary sexual characteristics by about 26 cm carapace length (Leuteritz 2002). Mature females produce up to three clutches per season with 1–5 eggs per clutch (Leuteritz and Ravolanaivo 2005), leading to an estimated average production of two clutches of four eggs each per breeding female; an estimated 82% of mature females breed in an average year (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007). No solid data exists on longevity but estimated life span is believed to be up to 100 years (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007). A detailed overview of natural history is presented by Pedrono (2008).","Threats to the tortoise’s survival include collection and habitat loss (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989, Nussbaum and Raxworthy, 1998, O’Brien 2002, O’Brien <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 2003). “Collection” can be subdivided into two further categories: collection for the international wildlife trade and collection for utilization by local people.<br/><br/>International collection has been documented with Asian smugglers collecting tortoises for the pet trade and for their livers (Behler 2002).<br/><br/>However, domestic utilization of this species is of greater concern. Within Madagascar, the Mahafaly and the Antandroy, whose land covers the range of the Radiated Tortoise do not utilize the tortoise. They have a taboo (termed a 'fady') against eating or touching the tortoises (Nussbaum and Raxworthy 1998, Lingard <em>et al</em>. 2003). However, large quantities of Radiated Tortoises are gathered by people from other areas of Madagascar who recently moved into this region, or by Malagasy people who are passing through. O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) estimated that up to 45,000 adult Radiated Tortoises are harvested each year. Anecdotal information indicates that annual harvest numbers have increased since then; estimates calculated at the 2005 PHVA workshop ranged from 22,000 to 241,000 tortoises collected annually. Tortoise meat is especially popular around Christmas and Easter (Lewis 1995). Declared protected areas are insufficiently patrolled and resourced to deter large-scale collection right inside these nominal strongholds.<br/><br/>Besides being used as food, the Malagasy often keep the tortoises as pets and in pens with chickens and ducks as a means of warding off poultry diseases (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989, Leuteritz <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Habitat loss includes deforestation for use as agricultural land, the grazing of livestock, and the burning of wood for charcoal (Nussbaum and Raxworthy 1998). Recent analyses by Conservation International (May 2007) of the state of the spiny forest biome, using aerial imagery, indicate that deforestation rates have significantly increased over the last five years (compared with the period 1990-2000) (H. Crowley pers. comm. to Leuteritz). The 2001 Conservation Assessment and Management Plan (CAMP) workshop estimated habitat loss at 21-50% during the period 1990-2000, and forecast a habitat loss rate of 51-80% for the period 2001-2010. Harper <em>et al</em>. (2007) documented a consistent annual forest loss rate of 1.2% for the spiny forest (primary Radiated Tortoise habitat) throughout the period 1970-2000, and measured an overall reduction from 29,782 to 21,322 sq km over this period, a 29% reduction in less than one tortoise generation.<br/><br/>Invasive plant species affecting habitat suitability were considered a significant threat at the 2001 CAMP workshop.","Historically this species has been quite abundant, often being found along roadways and has served as symbol of Madagascar's south. This is not the case anymore. Tortoises are not found along major roadways but may be locally abundant in certain areas. According to O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) the species is declining, with its range having contracted by one fifth over the last 25 years. Lewis (1995) reports density estimates based on line distance sampling of 262.2 to 1,076.7 tortoises/km², from which he extrapolated a conservative total population size of 1.6–4 million. Leuteritz <em>et al</em>. (2005) reported densities of 27–5,744 tortoises/km² with a total population estimate of 12 million. Rioux Paquette <em>et al</em>. (2006) undertook a microsatellite genetic analysis, which identified three distinct conservation units with relatively high assignments rates. The study supported the role of the Menarandra and Manambovo Rivers as major barriers to the dispersal for most Radiated Tortoises.<br/><br/>Population models were calculated at the 2005 Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) workshop based on a number of variables including estimated population size and annual harvest intensity. Depending on the variables selected, the species was predicted to reach extinction at various times, with most estimates clustering around 45 years into the future (range 20-100+ years) (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007).",Decreasing,"Radiated Tortoises are found in the dry spiny forests of southern and southwestern Madagascar, from the area of Amboasary in the south across the Karimbola and Mahafaly plateaus north of Tuléar (where the habitat is highly fragmented and tortoises may be close to extinction) to Morombe. They are usually found in a narrow band within about 50 to 100 km from the coast (Glaw and Vences 1994, Leuteritz <em>et al</em>. 2005). Is sympatric with <em>Pyxis arachnoides</em>. The species' core range compries about 10,000 square km.",,Terrestrial,"Very little research has been done on this species and most of it only in the last ten years.<br/><br/>The species is protected nationally under Malagasy law (Decree 60126; October, 1960). Internationally, the Radiated Tortoise was listed as Category A of the African Conservation Convention of 1968, and, since 1975, it has been listed on Appendix I of CITES, which affords species the highest level of protection (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989, Hilton-Taylor 2000).<br/><br/>Four protected areas and three additional sites (Lac Tsimanampetsotsa National Park 43,200 ha, Beza-Mahafaly Special Reserve 67,568 ha, Cap Sainte Marie Special Reserve 1,750 ha, Andohahela National Park 76,020 ha, and Berenty Private Reserve 250 ha, Site of Biological Interest – (1) Hatokaliotsy 21,850 ha and (2) PK3 north of Tulear 12,500 ha) fall within the range of this species. A captive breeding centre (Village de Tortues de Mangily) was established in Ifaty.<br/><br/>In August 2005, an international meeting of the Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) group produced an alarming prediction that without immediate and significant intervention, viable populations of Radiated Tortoises will likely be extirpated from the wild within one tortoise generation, that is, 45 years (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007). It was suggested that a systematic monitoring program be established. This will have to involve the training of local people so that the programme can be viable. This and other recommended conservation measures are detailed in the PHVA workshop report (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007). In addition, monitoring of exploitation trends at the wholesale and consumer parts of the trade chain (surveys of markets, traders and restaurants in Madagascar; monitoring international pet trade) is important.<br/><br/>Additionally, ensuring adequate coverage of Radiated Tortoise populations as Madagascar expands its protected area network is essential. Research on habitat usage, specifically the impacts and benefits from <em>Opuntia</em> and other invasive vegetation, is desirable.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Thus criterion C1 is met.<br/><br/>Based on population dynamics and threat impacts, by analogy with <em>Astrochelys radiata</em>, the species is nearly certain to go extinct within the next generation if current threats continue unabated.","The species is found in the Baly Bay region (over an area of approximately 700 km², though only 66 km² of this is considered suitable habitat). This region is comprised of dry deciduous forest, savanna, and mangrove swamps. The climate is tropical with a distinctly seasonal rainfall patterns. Angonoka utilize bamboo-scrub habitat, which is considered to be a secondary stage of the dry deciduous forest (Curl <em>et al</em>. 1986). Bamboo-scrub habitat consists of a mosaic of shrubs, bamboo, savanna grasses, and open, non vegetated areas. The shrubs are generally under 2 m and the dominant species include <em>Bauhinia</em> sp. and <em>Terminalia</em> sp. Bamboo (<em>Perrierbambos madagascariensis</em>) occurs in dense thickets within the habitat. Andrianandrasana (2000) estimates there are 7,975 ha of suitable habitat of which 6,669 ha have tortoises occupying them. Elevation is less than 50 m above sea level (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1999a and b).<br/><br/>Adult male tortoises are larger and heavier than females. Mean adult male length and weight is 414.8 mm (range 361-486 mm) and 10.3 kg (range 7.2-18.9 kg) respectively. Mean adult female length and weight is 370.1 mm (range 307-426 mm) and 8.8 kg (range 5.5-12 kg) respectively (Pedrono and Markwell 2001).<br/><br/>According to Smith (1999) grasses and forbs in open rocky areas of bamboo scrub habitat appeared to be important food items. Feeding was observed from October through May. Tortoises were observed to feed upon herbs, forbs and shrubs (<em>Bauhinia</em> sp. and <em>Terminalia</em> sp.) rather than grasses. Tortoises were never observed feeding on live bamboo, however, on several occasions they consumed leaf litter that included dead bamboo leaves. Angonoka were also observed feeding on dried carnivore and African bush pig feces (Smith 1999).<br/><br/>Smith (1999) estimates sexual maturity at a minimum of 15 years old. A study by Pedrono <em>et al</em>. (2001) showed the reproductive period was from 15 January to 30 May and tortoises produced 1-6 eggs (mean 3.2) per clutch and up 4 (mean 2.45) clutches per season. Despite low densities the egg fertility rate was 71.9% and resulting hatching success was 54.6% (Pedrono <em>et al</em>. 2001). This yields an estimated annual production of 3.2x2.45x54.6% = 4.3 hatchlings per reproducing female. By analogy with <em>Astrochelys radiata</em>, the average age of reproducing animals per generation time is estimated as being 42 years (Madagascar WS 2008).","The tortoise’s restricted distribution and threatened status are believed to result from exploitation in historical times and from frequent human-caused fires, which were deliberately started to create and improve grazing conditions for Zebu cattle (Juvik <em>et al</em>. 1981, Curl <em>et al</em>. 1985). According to Lewis <em>et al</em>. (2005) ""since 1995, the local communities, with the assistance of the Water and Forests Department and Durrell Wildlife, have annually burnt the savannah fringes during the wet season creating a system of natural firebreaks"". Outbreaks of fires within tortoise habitat have continued to decrease annually. There was less than 50 ha of tortoise habitat burnt in 2004, but larger areas of Angonoka habitat were burnt in other years.<br/><br/>The other major and ongoing threat comes from illegal collection for the international pet trade (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2005, Pedrono 2008); marked wild animals have been recorded from pet trade in Asia and despite some successful enforcement and confiscation actions, the species remains in extremely high demand in the global illegal pet trade which severely threatens the remaining wild animals.","It was estimated that the total wild population is about 600 individuals (440 to 770). These are found within five subpopulations: two to the east of the Andranomavo river (Sada and Beheta) and three to the west of the river (Ambatomainty, Betainalika, Andrafiafaly) (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1999, Pedrono 2000). Based on distance sampling surveys and the extent of suitable habitat (by 2005), DWCT estimated a maximum of 800 wild animals. Recent impacts (illegal collection for the international pet trade) have reduced the estimated population substantially, and the wild population is currently estimated to possibly be as low as 400 individuals, of which 200 adults (G.

The project was established as collaboration between Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (then known as Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) and the Water and Forests Department of the Government of Madagascar, together with support from the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF). Given the extreme rarity of the species, the initial goal was the establishment of a captive-breeding project. This was successfully achieved. In December 2004, the captive project had 224 captive-bred juveniles from 17 founder adults (10 males, 7 females). From the 1990s, work progressed to ecological research on the species in the wild, and developing conservation strategies with the surrounding local communities. The latter work formed the basis of community-led firebreaks and with the communities themselves proposing the creation of a park to safeguard the tortoise and the remaining forests.<br/><br/>Ongoing monitoring of the species' occurrence in the global pet trade is needed, along with effective enforcement and repatriation and/or safe, conservation-oriented maintenance of confiscated animals in appropriate facilities.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

In previous assessments in 1996 and 2000,&#160;<em>C. parkeri</em>&#160;was listed as Vulnerable VU D2 (old criteria 2.3) owing to its relatively restricted range and exploitation pressures, though its range and extent of occurrence as currently understood are too wide for such a listing. It is therefore now assessed as Near Threatened (NT) as it almost qualifies for a threatened listing under criterion A4d. There is inadequate evidence at this time to document that its population has declined by as much as 30% on an ongoing basis over three generations; we assess its potential decline as no more than 10–20% on an ongoing basis over three generations.

43526147,6494,Dermochelys coriacea,Vulnerable,A2bd,2013,2013-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Rationale</em></p><p>The global population of Leatherback turtles (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) comprises seven subpopulations (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Material) that vary widely in population size, geographic range, and population trends, and are the appropriate units for assessment of global conservation status for this species (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). As such, we performed assessments for each of the seven subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Due to this species’ geographically widespread distribution, Criterion A was the only appropriate criterion for assessment that could be applied to the global Leatherback population. Generation length was estimated as 30 years. Estimation of global population change based on subpopulation trends (weighted by subpopulation sizes relative to the global population size) produced an estimate of -40.1% decline over the past three generations (see Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material), corresponding to a category of <em>Vulnerable based on Criterion A2 (i.e., threats are not reversible nor have they ceased), subcriteria b (i.e., an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon—annual nest counts—was used) and d (i.e., decline was due to actual or potential levels of exploitation)</em>. In contrast, assessment of the data under Criterion A4—past, present, and future abundance—revealed that the global Leatherback population trends over three generations will no longer meet thresholds for threat categories by 2020 (-29.4%), and will be increasing by 2030 (3%) and beyond (104% by 2040) (see Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Therefore, within the next ten years, the global Leatherback population might no longer qualify as “Threatened”—i.e. a category listing of Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered—according to the IUCN Red List Criteria.</p><p>	However, future population increases will be dependent on the success of conservation actions mitigating current and future threats to this species throughout its range, especially in breeding and foraging areas, and on no new threats arising (e.g. climate change) that could cause population declines. Moreover, nearly 99% of the global population (based on data available currently) will be contained within the Northwest Atlantic, which obscures the declines of the Pacific subpopulations and threatened status of other relatively small subpopulations (e.g. Southwest Atlantic, Southwest Indian) (see Figure 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), not to mention data deficient subpopulations (Northeast Indian, Southeast Atlantic). While these results demonstrate that Leatherbacks, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Leatherback population. For this reason, the subpopulation-level Red List assessments for Leatherbacks should be given priority in evaluating the true global extinction risk for this species.<br/><br/><em>Justification</em></p>  <p>Comprehensive analyses of 39 existing datasets—including 28 time series datasets with ≥10 years of data—of abundance of nesting females or their nesting activities on beaches revealed different population trends among subpopulations, but a global decline overall based on subpopulation trends weighted by subpopulation size three generations ago relative to combined global population size (see Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material&#160;for all datasets used). Overall, considering only datasets with ≥10 yr of abundance data, the total global abundance across Leatherback subpopulations had declined from 90,599 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> to 54,262 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> over three generations until 2010. Using average conversion factors from different subpopulations to provide bracketed estimates of nesting female abundance (i.e. 5 and 7 clutches per female, three years for re-migration intervals, intermediate between subpopulation averages; TEWG 2007, Reina <em>et al</em>. 2002), these annual nesting abundance values correspond to approximately 12,943-18,120 nesting females yr<sup>-1 </sup>(or 38,828-54,359 adult females) three generations ago and 7,752-10,852 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup> (or 23,255-32,557 adult females) in 2010. Because we did not include abundance data from several rookeries that had &lt;10 yr of data—including Gabon, which is the largest Leatherback rookery in the world (Witt <em>et al</em>. 2009), as well as Grand Riviere and Fishing Pond, Trinidad, Armila, Panama, and Gulf of Urubá, Colombia (TEWG 2007, Patiño-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2008)—in our annual and total abundance subpopulation and global abundance estimates, these values should be considered conservative estimates.</p>  <p>Overall, although the global listing for Leatherbacks was derived by abundance-weighted analyses of three-generation trends for all subpopulations with available data, it is not an appropriate representation of conservation status of biologically relevant population units (i.e. subpopulations) that make up the global Leatherback population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by the Red List Categories), but also in how categories were derived for each subpopulation (as indicated by the Red List Criteria used) (see Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Specifically, final threat categories were triggered by thresholds under different criteria, depending on whether a subpopulation has declined significantly over time (e.g. East Pacific, West Pacific), was geographically constrained (e.g. Southwest Indian Ocean), or characterized by small (e.g. Southwest Indian Ocean) or very small population sizes (e.g. Southwest Atlantic Ocean). Therefore, the variation in conservation status among subpopulations warrants preference for subpopulation assessments over the global assessment when evaluating and describing the global conservation status of Leatherbacks.</p>  <p>Presently, the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation—i.e. from Florida, USA throughout the Wider Caribbean—is large and increasing (TEWG 2007) (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the Southeast Atlantic subpopulation—i.e. West Africa, especially Gabon—is the largest in the world (Witt <em>et al</em>. 2009), but long-term trend data are not available for this assessment (TEWG 2007). The existence of these large (and increasing in at least one case) subpopulations makes it extremely unlikely that Leatherbacks globally will go extinct in the near future. If current trends in the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation continue, the global population trend might no longer meet thresholds for IUCN Threatened categories (i.e., Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered) within ten years (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). In fact, if current trends continue, future global population sizes are projected to increase to 184,662 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (approximately 26,380-36,932 females yr<sup>-1</sup>, 79,141-110,797 adult females total) within one generation (i.e. by 2040). The projected abundance of the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone will account for nearly 99% of the global Leatherback population abundance by that time (Figure 3 and Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), and increase from 46% of historical global population abundance three generations ago.</p>  <p>In spite of the large and increasing Northwest Atlantic subpopulation, the magnitudes of declines for the East Pacific subpopulation (i.e., which nests along the Pacific coast of the Americas) and, to a slightly lesser extent, the West Pacific subpopulation (i.e., Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands) over three generations were the main driver the global decline result. Specifically, the East Pacific subpopulation has declined by <em>&gt; </em>97% over three generations (from &gt;35,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> to &lt;1,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, or &gt;5,000 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup> to &lt; 140 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Eckert 1993, Santidrián Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2007), and its historic abundance accounted for roughly 39% of the estimated global abundance three generations ago (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Similarly, the West Pacific subpopulation has declined &gt;80% over three generations, from &gt;12,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (2,600 females yr<sup>-1</sup>) to &lt;2,200 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (&lt;500 females yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Eckert 1993, Chan and Liew 1996, Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2007, Hitipeuw <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013), and its historic abundance accounted for 14% of the estimated global abundance three generations ago. Both of these subpopulations are projected to decline further in coming decades (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Population declines in these subpopulations (and others) have been attributed to extensive egg harvest and mortality due to incidental capture in fishing gear (Eckert 1993, Wallace and Saba 2009, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Considering the precedent of the collapse of the historically large Pacific subpopulations, the persistence of significant threats in all regions (see Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2011 and Eckert <em>et al</em>. 2012 for review) warrants concern for the future viability of even the largest subpopulations. Current efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats must be maintained—or even augmented, where possible—to reverse declines in Pacific and Indian Ocean subpopulations and to sustain population growth in the Northwest Atlantic.</p>  <p>To explore future projections of Leatherback subpopulation and global abundance and trends, we also applied Criterion A4, which analyzes the global population trend within time intervals from the past, present, and future (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Because the length of three generations (~90 yr) was greater than the length of our available datasets, we used the historical abundance values shown in Tables 3 and 4 (see&#160;Supplementary Material) as the baseline population sizes for “moving window” analyses. According to our assessment of the data under Criterion A4, it would no longer qualify as “Threatened” according to IUCN Red List Criteria by 2020 (three-generation decline of 29.4%), and would qualify as Least Concern by 2030 (3% increase) under IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2011) (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). This discrepancy between A4 and A2 illustrates a dichotomy in how extinction risk is assessed by these two criteria, despite the same empirical data being used for assessments. Whereas A2 assesses percent decline over time, using the historical abundance as the baseline, A4 uses historical as well as current abundance to project future abundance, and as such accounts for recent growth in subpopulations in the global population estimate. Because the IUCN Guidelines stipulate that multiple criteria be evaluated, the criterion that triggers the highest threat category must be selected for the official assessment. Therefore, Leatherbacks globally are considered <em>Vulnerable (A2b,d)</em> based on IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2011). </p>  <p>Nonetheless, these results further illustrate the inability of the global assessment to adequately characterize variation among subpopulations. The likelihood of global extinction of this species is extremely low (Tables 2 and 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material); however, the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone is projected to account for nearly 99% of total global Leatherback abundance by 2040, with four other subpopulations for which data were available for this assessment accounting for the remaining 1% (Figure 3 and Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Such a global assessment produces a result indicating no risk of species-level extinction based on the mere existence of any Leatherback subpopulation, while obscuring the dire conservation situation of declining or extinct subpopulations (e.g., the Pacific subpopulations). This type of assessment and its result are contrary to the <a href=""http://iucn-mtsg.org/about/vision-mission/"">IUCN SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group’s (MTSG) mission</a> to guide conservation of marine turtles and their ecological roles. For these reasons, the MTSG defined subpopulations (i.e., regional management units; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) for all marine turtle species, including Leatherbacks, to provide a biologically described framework for evaluating conservation status of appropriate population segments. A global marine turtle population is an amalgam of its subpopulations, all of which are valuable for maintaining the health of the “species” in terms of evolutionary history, genetic diversity, and life history variations. For these reasons, the inability of marine turtle global assessments to appropriately account for variation among subpopulations (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review) further supports the primacy of subpopulation assessments when describing conservation status of marine turtles globally.</p>  <p>Previous global Leatherback assessments (Pritchard 1982, Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996), including the previous Leatherback Red List assessment (Sarti Martinez 2000), also described global declines in Leatherbacks. However, these previous assessments lacked the geographic breadth and rigour of time series datasets accessed for the current assessment. Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) estimated the global Leatherback population in 1995 to be approximately 34,500 adult females (range: 26,200-42,900 females), and stated that this value was roughly a third of the only existing global estimate at the time (115,000 adult females; Pritchard 1982). However, there were several significant assumptions in the Pritchard (1982) estimate that make its use as a reliable global population estimate tenuous, not the least of which was the lack of robust, nesting beach-based estimates of the East Pacific subpopulation abundance on which the regional and global estimates were constructed (see Mrosovsky 2003 for review). Sarti Martinez (2000) assessed the global Leatherback population as Critically Endangered largely on the evidence of significant declines in the East Pacific subpopulation (based on the Pritchard [1982] and Spotila <em>et al</em>. [1996] estimates) and Malaysian rookery, despite some indications of large populations in other regions, such as the Northwest and Southeast Atlantic.</p>  <p>In addition, abundance of several rookeries has increased substantially in the time since these assessments were conducted. For example, estimates for Trinidad, St. Croix, Puerto Rico, and Florida used by Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) were all substantially lower—by an order of magnitude in some cases—than current estimates (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the current assessment only included time series datasets of a decade or longer in abundance estimates, whereas Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) included abundance estimates based on variable numbers of nesting seasons. The 2010 abundance estimates presented in the current assessment are generally lower, but overlap with the 1995 range in estimated abundance reported by Spotila et al. (1996). If abundance estimates from all rookeries with available nesting data (e.g. Panama [~8,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>], Colombia [2,300 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>], Trinidad [&gt;40,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, and especially Gabon [36,185-126,480 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>]; Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material) were included in the 2010 assessment, the total global abundance of Leatherbacks in 2010 would be much higher than the estimate shown in Table 3, and would exceed the average estimate of Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996). However, this is not necessarily indicative of a global population increase, but rather an increase in available information. Therefore, given the availability of new datasets from all Leatherback subpopulations globally, use of previous estimates (Pritchard 1982, Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996) to characterize global Leatherback population abundance is no longer appropriate.</p>  <p>Interpreting the current assessment (2010) in the context of previous assessments and available data at present, the global Leatherback population has not collapsed, and, in fact, appears to be larger than estimated in previous global assessments (Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996). This result appears counter-intuitive with the <em>Vulnerable</em> category to which this subpopulation has been assigned, but it can be traced to the nature of the procedure for applying Criterion A to long-lived, widely distributed species like marine turtles (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review). The change in IUCN Red List Category from <em>Critically Endangered</em> (in 2000) to <em>Vulnerable</em> (assessment year 2010) is mostly due to new datasets made available for assessment, and associated detection of increasing trends that were not reported previously, as well as a rigorous application of the IUCN 3.1 Criteria. The continued severe declines of the Pacific subpopulations require urgent and effective conservation interventions to prevent complete collapse (Spotila <em>et al</em>. 2000, Santidrián Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, the projected increase in the global population is predicated entirely on continued growth of the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone, which itself depends on sustained conservation efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats.</p>  <p><em>Assessment Procedure:</em></p>  <p>Given the widespread, long-lived nature of Leatherback turtles, Criterion A (i.e., decline in population of mature individuals over time) is the only appropriate criterion that could be used for this assessment; the restricted geographic range and small population size criteria (Criterion B, C, and D) did not apply, and no population viability analysis was available (Criterion E). However, Criteria A-D were applied in subpopulation assessments (see Leatherback subpopulation assessments for details; Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material).</p>  <p>We obtained time series datasets of abundance of nesting females or their nesting activities collected on Leatherback rookeries (i.e., nesting beaches) around the world, and organized data by subpopulations. For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (NRC 2010). Conversion from number of nests to number of nesting females requires estimates of clutch frequency (i.e. number of clutches per nesting female per breeding season) (e.g. Reina <em>et al</em>. 2002), which are not available for all rookeries and subpopulations. Therefore, we presented and analysed all abundance data in numbers of confirmed nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, as this metric was the most commonly available (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). See <em>Sources of Uncertainty</em> for discussion of caveats associated with these conversion factors.</p>  <p>We calculated annual and overall population trends for each rookery within a subpopulation, and then calculated average subpopulation trends by weighting rookery population trends by rookery abundance 3 generations ago relative to subpopulation abundance three generations ago. We then repeated this step to derive the global population trend by weighting subpopulation trends by subpopulation abundance three generations ago relative to global abundance three generations ago (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). We only included time series datasets of ≥10 yr in trend estimations, although we included all rookeries for which we obtained abundance values in the overall summary tables (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Because rookeries represent varying proportions of total subpopulation sizes, we ensured that time series from major rookeries within each subpopulation were included in analyses such that the majority of subpopulation abundance was represented. In cases where that was not possible (e.g. Southeast Atlantic, Northeast Indian), we did not derive a subpopulation trend, and such cases were excluded from calculation of global trends.</p>  <p>The most recent year for available abundance data across all rookeries and subpopulations was 2010. Where time series ended prior to 2010, we estimated population sizes for each rookery through 2010 based on the population trend for existing years (e.g. French Guiana, Trinidad). Furthermore, if a longer time series for a rookery within a subpopulation was available that reflected a trend not captured by shorter time series, we estimated historical abundance to calculate overall declines for that subpopulation. For example, abundance data for three of five index sites in the Mexican Pacific—the East Pacific subpopulation—begin in the early 1980s, while the remaining sites (i.e., Barra de la Cruz and Cahuitán, Oaxaca) begin in the early 1990s (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). All other sites in Mexico, as well as other sites within the same subpopulation (i.e., those in Costa Rica), showed a decline of &gt;97%, whereas the Barra de la Cruz and Cahuitán showed much less dramatic declines, because the time series began after the broader population decline had already begun to occur. Given the synchrony in inter-annual abundance fluctuations and historical reports of high abundance among these rookeries (Eckert 1993), we assumed that the abundance at Barra de la Cruz and Cahuitán was similar to that of other Mexican rookeries at the beginning of those time series, i.e., 1982 (L. Sarti Martínez pers. comm.). This allowed us to standardize trend and abundance estimates within the Mexican rookeries. &#160; &#160;</p>  <p>To apply Criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN 2011). In the case of the Leatherback, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 30 years (see below). For Criterion A2, data from three generations ago (~100 yr) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e. assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 yr or more—are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review). Abundance data from ~100 yr ago are not available for Leatherbacks anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate&#160;because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations (~100 years, one generation estimated 30 yr; see below) ago was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply Criterion A to subpopulations (see separate subpopulation assessments) and the global population, we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations.<br/><br/>We also evaluated to the global population against Criterion A4 (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), using the same overall scheme as described above. Criterion A4 permits for analysis of population trend during a “moving window” of time, i.e. over three generations, but where the time window must include the past, present, and future. Furthermore, multiple time-frames are to be examined, and the maximum decline calculated for a given time-frame is to be compared to the thresholds (IUCN 2011). Therefore, we made the same assumption about earliest available historical abundance being equivalent to the population abundance for generations past, and estimated future population abundance in 2020, 2030, and 2040, which all fall within the next generation (i.e., 30 yr). These future projections assume that the derived population trend will continue without deviation during the next generation. Implicit in this assumption is that no changes to degree of threats or conservation efforts impacting rookeries, subpopulations, or the global population will occur during that time. Based on available information, threats to Leatherbacks globally that have caused observed declines have not ceased and are not reversible (see Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011 and Eckert <em>et al</em>. 2012 for review), making this a reasonable assumption in the absence of better information. The global population will no longer be “Threatened” according to IUCN Red List thresholds by 2020 (-29.4% decline over three generations), and will be increasing by 2030 (3% increase) and beyond (104% increase by 2040)—i.e. IUCN category of Near Threatened or Least Concern—according to Criterion A4, depending on the “time window” applied (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). This result is due mainly to the currently large and growing Northwest Atlantic subpopulation, and in spite of the lack of sufficient information for the Southeast Atlantic subpopulation and the continued declines in the East Pacific and West Pacific subpopulations.<br/><br/><em>Estimating Generation Length:<br/><br/></em>Leatherback age at maturity is uncertain, and estimates range widely (see Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011 for review). Reported estimates fall between 9-15 yr, based on skeletochronology (Zug and Parham 1996), and inferences from mark-recapture studies (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2005). Furthermore, updated skeletochronological analyses estimated Leatherback age at maturity to be between 26-32 yr (mean 29 yr) (Avens <em>et al</em>. 2009). Extrapolations of captive growth curves under controlled thermal and trophic conditions suggested that size at maturity could be reached in 7-16 yr (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011). Thus, a high degree of variance and uncertainty remains about Leatherback age at maturity in the wild. Likewise, Leatherback lifespan is unknown. Long-term monitoring studies of Leatherback nesting populations have tracked individual adult females over multiple decades (e.g. Santidrián Tomillo&#160;<em>et al</em>. unpublished data, Nel and Hughes unpublished data), but precise estimates of reproductive lifespan and longevity for Leatherbacks are currently unavailable.<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population; older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual (IUCN 2011). Thus, for the purposes of this assessment, we estimated generation length to be 30 yr, or equal to the age at maturity (estimated to be 20 yr on average), plus a conservative estimate of reproductive half-life of 10 yr, as assumed by Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996).<br/><br/><em>Sources of Uncertainty:<br/><br/></em>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (NRC 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (NRC 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Leatherbacks, including age at maturity (see Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011 for review), generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, re-migration intervals, etc.). These values can vary among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends (SWOT Scientific Advisory Board 2011). For example, monitoring effort on Matura beach, Trinidad, has changed multiple times since the early 1990s, which necessitated a modelling exercise to estimate a complete time series for years with reliable monitoring levels (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, there was a general lack of measures of variance around annual counts provided for the assessment, which could be erroneously interpreted as equally high confidence in all estimates. Measures of variance around annual counts would provide information about relative levels of monitoring effort within and among rookeries, and thus reliability of resulting estimates. For all of these reasons, results of this assessment of global population decline should be considered with caution. For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em>D. coriacea</em> is an oceanic, deep-diving marine turtle inhabiting tropical, subtropical, and subpolar seas. Leatherbacks make extensive migrations between different feeding areas at different seasons, and to and from nesting areas. Leatherbacks feed predominantly on jellyfishes, salps and siphonophores. Females usually produce several (3-10) clutches of 60-90 eggs in a reproductive season, and typically have a re-migration interval of multiple years (2+) between subsequent reproductive seasons. For a thorough review of Leatherback biology, please see Eckert <em>et al</em>. (2012).</p>  <p><br/></p>","<p>Threats to Leatherbacks vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Leatherbacks, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:</p>  <p>1) Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</p>  <p>2) Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e. consumption, commercial products);</p>  <p>3) Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc.;</p>  <p>4) Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e. through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (e.g. fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</p>  <p>5) Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (e.g. increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</p>  <p>	The relative impacts of individual threats to all Leatherback subpopulations were assessed by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Leatherbacks globally, followed by human consumption of Leatherback eggs, meat, or other products, and coastal development. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Leatherbacks—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts.&#160;</p>","<p>Leatherbacks are a single species globally comprising seven biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010), which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. RMUs are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are seven Leatherback RMUs (hereafter subpopulations): Northwest Atlantic Ocean, Southeast Atlantic Ocean, Southwest Atlantic Ocean, Northeast Indian Ocean, Southwest Indian Ocean, East Pacific Ocean, and West Pacific Ocean (Figure 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world (Dutton<em> et al</em>. 1999, 2013), and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace<em> et al</em>. 2010; shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Leatherbacks are distributed circumglobally, with nesting sites on tropical sandy beaches and foraging ranges that extend into temperate and sub-polar latitudes (see Figure 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material&#160;and global distribution map). See Eckert <em>et al</em>. (2012) for review of Leatherback geographic range.&#160;<strong></strong></p>","Leatherback eggs and animals are taken for human use (i.e. consumption and commercial products), eggs are also eaten by domestic animals (e.g. dogs).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Leatherbacks are protected under various Conventions, national and international laws, treaties, agreements, and memoranda of understanding. A partial list of international conservation instruments that provide legislative protection for Leatherbacks are: Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); the Leatherback’s inclusion in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS); the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC); the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA); the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection; and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.</p>  <p>Long-term efforts to reduce or eliminate threats to Leatherbacks on nesting beaches have been successful in many places (e.g. Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chacón-Chaverri and Eckert 2007, Santidrián Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti Martínez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007) but not all places (e.g. Chan and Liew 1996). Reducing Leatherback bycatch has become a primary focus for many conservation projects around the world, and some mitigation efforts are showing promise (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2005; Gilman <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2011). However, threats to Leatherbacks—bycatch mortality and egg consumption, in particular—persist, and in some places, continue to hinder population recovery (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012; Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013; Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2013). For depleted Leatherback populations to recover, the most prevalent and impactful threats must be reduced wherever they occur, whether on nesting beaches or in feeding, migratory, or other habitats (Bellagio Report 2007; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013); a holistic approach that addresses threats at all life history stages needs to be implemented (Dutton and Squires 2011). Therefore, current conservation efforts, legal protections, and resources supporting those mechanisms must be maintained—and augmented, wherever possible—to reverse population declines and sustain stable and increasing population trends among Leatherback subpopulations. Regional and local efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats should be designed to address threats at appropriate scales, and implemented with participation of appropriate stakeholders.</p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

No other information has been changed.<br/><br/>Based on habitat loss of this habitat-specific species, it has lost about 40% of suitable habitat in the period 1970-2000; habitat loss is accelerating and exacerbated by progressive fragmentation of remaining habitat, leading to an estimate of over 50% loss of remaining habitat in the next generation if current trends continue. Thus the species appears to meet the criteria for Critically Endangered (CR) under criterion A4c (90% habitat loss in three generations). <br/><br/>In addition, the species has come under increasing direct exploitation for consumption in the past decade, mainly to meet the void created by declining populations of radiated tortoises (a larger and preferred species for consumption). This may amount to meeting the criteria for CR under criterion A4d. <br/><br/>These factors combine to an estimated population reduction of at least 80% over the past two plus one future generation. In parallel, population modeling predicts the species' extinction in 60 to 80 years, thus meeting CR under criterion E. The northern subspecies, <em>P. a. brygooi</em>, is under most severe pressures and requires priority conservation action.","The Spider Tortoise is found in Mikea forest habitat in the north and in communities of xerophytic spiny vegetation with low irregular rainfall dominated by Didiereaceae and <em>Ephorbia</em> in the south (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2007). Their habitat consists of sandy areas with spiny vegetation close to the coast. They do not tend to utilize rocky areas like <em>A. radiata</em> does (T. Leuteritz pers. obs.). Acccording to Walker <em>et al</em>. (2008) <em>P. a. arachnoides</em> was only recorded as feeding during the wet months, a period of increased activity. Tortoises are known to eat young leaves and cow dung with insect larva (Glaw and Vences 1994). Spider Tortoises reach a curved carapace length of up to 200 mm.<br/><br/>Very little is known about the reproduction of this species but it is believed to produce single egg clutches although the number of clutches per year are unknown (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989). Reproductive age is thought to be at about 12 years (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2004), and average reproductive age (=generation time) was conservatively estimated at 20 years at the 2008 Red List workshop. No solid data exists on longevity but estimated life span is believed to be up to 70 yrs (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007).","<em>Pyxis arachnoides</em> faces threats from habitat destruction and fragmentation (through conversion for agriculture, charcoal prduction, human-induced wildfires, and alien invasive plants). Recent analyses by Conservation International (May, 2007) of the state of the spiny forest biome, using aerial imagery, indicate that deforestation rates have significantly increased over the last five years (compared with the period 1990-2000) (H. Crowley pers. comm.). A loss of 21-50% was estimated to have occurred over the period 1970-2000 (an average annual rate of 1.2% spiny forest loss; Harper <em>et al</em>. 2007), and a further loss of 51-80% of remaining habitat was projected for the period 2002-2012 (CBSG 2001). Invasive plant species affecting habitat suitability were considered a significant threat at the 2001 CAMP workshop (CBSG 2001).<br/> <br/>In addition, the species has increasingly become subject to collection for the local food trade as Radiated Tortoise populations have been depleted, and exploitation has recently included harvesting for livers for export to Asia (Behler 2000). A pulse of legal export trade occurred during the period 2000-2004; CITES trade records show that about 4,000 animals were exported for the international pet trade in that time (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>Pyxis arachnoides</em> was recommended to be listed as Endangered (A3acd, B1b) at the 2001 CAMP workshop (CBSG, 2001).<br/><br/>Overall, the northern subspecies <em>P.a. brygooi</em> is under more severe habitat loss and exploitation pressures than the other two subspecies, with some <em>brygooi</em> subpopulations already extirpated and others declining.<br/><br/>The 2005 Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) workshop (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007) evaluated different threat and population scenarios, which variously yielded estimates of about 60 to 80 years of decline into extinction based on harvest rates of 2005. With increasing exploitation and accelerating loss of remaining habitat, this may be a conservative set of estimates.","The earliest information on populations comes from Bour (1981), who anecdotally stated that <em>P. arachnoides</em> was localized but not rare. Raxworthy and Nussbaum (2000) estimate that there were more than ten populations and that the area of distribution could cover more than 2,000 km². Jesu and Schimmenti (1995) who undertook the first quantitative estimate of population density reported approximately three individuals per ha. Walker <em>et al</em>. (2008) report densities of 4.63 and 2.08 tortoises per ha in the wet and dry seasons respectively. Both these studies were on <em>P. a. arachnoides</em>. A rough total estimate of 2-3 million animals was recorded by Pedrono (2008). <br/><br/>Hinge mobility of the three subspecies decreases from south to north (Glaw and Vences 1994, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008):<br/><em>P. a. oblonga</em> - plastron with black markings on scutes and anterior lobe will close completely to touch carapace (mobile).<br/><em>P. a. arachnoides</em> - plastron totally devoid of markings and anterior lobe will close partially but not touch carapace (less mobile).<br/><em>P. a. brygooi</em> - plastron totally devoid of markings but anterior lobe will not close fully to touch carapace (rigid).",Decreasing,"The Spider Tortoise is found only in the arid region of the coastal areas of southwestern Madagascar, from the coast up to 10-50 kilometres inland going as far north as Morombe (Glaw and Vences 1994, Henkel and Schmidt 2000).

All 14 adults (plus one male later found at the San Diego Zoo) were taken to the Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz Island to begin a breeding program. The genetic diversity of the 15 tortoises is lower than that found in other Galápagos tortoise populations, suggesting that the Española population had been low for some time and had undergone a previous bottleneck.

Further impacts were suffered by the introduction of goats (which competed for food with tortoises and affected vegetation regeneration structure). Goats were&#160;eradicated from Española in 1978.&#160;Their long-term impact, along with the absence of giant tortoises, however, has resulted in dense thickets of woody vegetation at a level not evident for the last 500-1000 years, making it difficult for tortoises to disperse to all of their historical range (Gibbs <em>et al</em>. 2014). Española is a small island, with a small area suitable for tortoises, placing them at risk of weather catastrophes. The island is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. Española has a low cactus population density (a result of the long-term presence of goats), which impacts the tortoises, as&#160;<em>Opuntia</em>&#160;cactus is an important resource for tortoises. The risk of future goat, rat, or other (re-)introductions remains. A second population of Española tortoises is currently being established on Santa Fé Island, to replace the undescribed native species that went extinct in the mid-1800s and to recover the ecological functions once provided by giant tortoises there. The Española tortoise is the species genetically and morphologically closest to the original Santa Fé tortoise (Poulakakis <em>et al</em>. 2012). This second subpopulation of <em>Chelonoidis hoodensis</em> on Santa Fé will serve as an insurance colony for this species.&#160;</p>","<p>                    </p><p>Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size was estimated to have been about 2,400 adults (J.P.

An intensive conservation breeding and re-introduction program has subsequently increased the population: nearly <a>1,900 </a>have been repatriated and of those approximately 50% survive (Gibbs <em>et al</em>. 2014). &#160;A total of&#160;1,837&#160;animals have been reintroduced to Española since 1975; reproduction by the reintroduced animals was first observed on the island in 1990 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1991). Most recent survey data (2010) estimate about 700 animals at Tunas/Caco in the central part of the island, and an additional 100 animals inland of Gardner Bay, about 800 in total. Given that about half of all repatriated animals survive, many have now reached reproductive age. Estimates for the current population vary from 11-20%comprised of &#160;<em>in situ</em> recruitment, thus repatriated animals make up 80-89% of the&#160;<em>in situ</em>&#160;population.&#160;The success of this program is also demonstrated by genetic&#160;analyses which indicate that while none of the tortoises sampled in 1994 had hatched on the island, of those tested in 2004 and 2007, 3%&#160;and 24% were&#160;<em>in situ </em>hatchlings , respectively (Milinkovitch <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;The recovery of this population despite its extremely low effective population size is probably due to Española tortoises having been subjected to population bottlenecks at different points in time prior to the arrival of humans in the Archipelago, rather than a single drastic reduction in recent times (Garrick <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2012). These declines may have been related to environmental fluctuations, which may have led to purging of deleterious recessive alleles improving the long-term survival prospects of the repatriated population (Milinkovitch <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Adult tortoises migrate up and down the elevation gradient, with movements timed to short, rainfall-driven bursts in lowland plant productivity. Nests occur between 6-149 m above sea level, in the hottest, driest and least productive part of the tortoise range. Nest temperature and egg survival declines with increasing elevation whereas hatchling survival and growth are highest at intermediate elevations. Hatchlings disperse between 100-600 m from their nests before becoming sedentary in ranges typically &lt;0.04 ha (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2012, unpubl. data).","As well as the severe declines suffered as a result of historical overexploitation for consumption by sailors and later settlers,&#160;the <em>Chelonoidis porteri</em>&#160;population has also been impacted by the effects of introduced vegetation, introduced goats, donkeys and other herbivores competing with it for food and altering vegetation dynamics, and introduced rats, cats, dogs, pigs, and ants preying on its eggs, hatchlings, and juveniles. Much of the upper sector of the species’ current range has been converted to agriculture and pastureland.&#160;While pastures may provide tortoises with nutritious forage, human encroachment, particularly where tortoise migration routes are disrupted by fences and roads, remains a cause for concern (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2015). As the population expands into new areas, there are more tortoises entering roadways and there have been several instances of tortoises being hit by cars. A potential future threat could arise due to current demands by some local stakeholders to open more trails into the park on the western side of Santa Cruz (for example an alternative trail to Tortuga Bay and a possible trail from the highlands to the coast near Eden Island). These efforts could cause serious problems for this tortoise population – both in terms of an increase of tortoises on the roads and greater access of humans to tortoise areas.","<p>                 </p><p>Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size of the population of&#160;<em>Chelonoidis porteri</em>&#160;was estimated as 35,000 adult animals (J.P.

Park rangers also protect nests with fencing to prevent access by pigs.&#160;Recent evidence of fire ants (<em>Solenopsis</em>) preying on tortoise hatchlings is cause for concern. Barriers to tortoise migration need to be reduced while controlling the remaining livestock, by engaging farmers in the use of raised barbed wire and other barrier alternatives to closed fencing. In recent years, as the tortoise population grows, more tortoises are showing up on roads and in farms where they were previously absent; this has resulted in some tortoises being hit by cars.

In addition, its extent of occurrence (EOO) is &lt;100 sq. km in a single population, with an ongoing reduction in area of occupnacy (AOO), qualifying it also for CR B1ab(ii).&#160;<em>Chelonoidis donfaustoi</em>&#160;was considered a part of&#160;<em>C. porteri&#160;</em>before its description as a new species in 2015 (Poulakakis <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;<em>Chelonoidis nigra&#160;</em>ssp.<em>&#160;porteri</em>&#160;was assessed as EN C2a on the 1996 IUCN Red List&#160;(&lt;2,500 adults, in decline, fragmented, no subpopulation larger than 250 adults), and the restricted&#160;<em>C. porteri</em>&#160;is currently assessed as CR A2bce.</p>","<p><em>Chelonoidis donfaustoi</em>&#160;is a large tortoise with dome-shaped carapace. As occurs in other Galápagos tortoise taxa, first reproduction likely occurs after 20 years of age, and a generation time of 60 years is estimated.&#160;Tortoises migrate between higher and lower elevation areas depending on seasonal availability of vegetation and suitable nesting sites in the lower elevation areas near the coast; higher elevation areas are dominated by males and some females, middle elevation areas by males, females and some juveniles, and lower elevation areas by females and juveniles (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2012). In recent years, &#160;due to changes in habitat and migratory routes, some juveniles are being observed in the highlands.</p>","As well as the severe declines suffered as a result of historical overexploitation for consumption by sailors and later settlers,&#160;<em>Chelonoidis donfaustoi</em>&#160;has also been reduced by the effects of introduced vegetation altering its habitat, introduced goats and donkeys competing with it for food and altering vegetation dynamics, and introduced rats, cats, dogs, pigs, and ants preying on its eggs, hatchlings, and juveniles. Much of the upper sector of the species’ current range has been converted to agriculture and pastureland.&#160;While pastures that dominate may provide tortoises with nutritious forage, human encroachment, particularly where tortoise migration routes are disrupted by fences and roads, remain cause for concern (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2015). Moreover this species harbours very low levels of genetic diversity, which severely impacts its capacity to rapidly adapt to changing conditions (Beheregaray <em>et al</em>. 2003, Russello <em>et al</em>. 2005, Poulakakis <em>et al</em>. 2015).","<p>The pre-human population size of tortoises at Cerro Fatal was estimated to have been about 13,500 adults (Gibbs, unpubl. data). None of the estimates made between 1960 and 2000, ranging from 23 to over 600, can be considered accurate. &#160;The current estimate is approximately 400 individuals, with an estimated 250 adults<a>, a 97% decline</a>. A complete population census is planned for 2017 or 2018.</p>",Increasing,"<p>                 </p><p><em>Chelonoidis donfaustoi</em>&#160;is only found on the eastern side of Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos Islands, Ecuador) extending from the moist highlands to the dry lowlands with range centred around Cerro Fatal, occupying an area currently estimated at about 40 sq. km.</p>  <p></p>",The tortoises on Santa Cruz&#160;were historically overexploited for consumption by sailors and early settlers (Pritchard 1996).&#160;Hunting of these tortoises by local residents continued throughout the first half of the 20th century.,Terrestrial,"<p>Legislation and regulation:&#160;<em>Chelonoidis donfaustoi</em>&#160;is protected under Ecuadorian national law. It has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1975 (as Testudinidae spp.), prohibiting all forms of commercial international trade. Most (84%) of Santa Cruz Island, including approximately 95% of the<em>&#160;</em>native range of&#160;<em>C.</em>&#160;<em>donfaustoi</em>,<em>&#160;</em>is protected as part of the Galapagos National Park. However, tortoises migrate into the agriculture zone and sometimes spend months there. Progress has been made with the eradication of goats and donkeys on Santa Cruz, and preventing future increases in these populations is vital. Pigs, the predator that causes the most destruction of tortoise nests throughout Santa Cruz, are regularly controlled in the nesting zones, but the population remains a threat. Park rangers also protect nests with fencing to prevent access by pigs.&#160;Recent evidence of fire ants (<em>Solenopsis</em>) preying on tortoise hatchlings is of even more concern. Barriers to tortoise migration need to be reduced while controlling the remaining livestock, by engaging farmers in the use of raised barbed wire and other barrier alternatives to closed fencing. Research needs include understanding the ecological impacts of migrations and human impacts on these migrations; understanding how tortoises contribute to dispersal of invasive plants; developing control of&#160;<em>Solenopsis</em>&#160;in tortoise nesting zones, and determining if there are critical areas for habitat management, particularly&#160;removal of&#160;invasive&#160;woody vegetation. Socioeconomic research would also be useful on how best to mediate the limited human-tortoise conflict that occurs in the farm zone; as the tortoise population grows and expands further into farmland, this will become of greater concern. .</p>",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Declines are due to a combination of exploitation for local consumption and fetish purposes plus some international pet trade; with habitat impacts including, in particular, aridification due to climate change and intensive use of water resources for agriculture. It is not thought to be in significant decline in the far eastern part of its range. Overall across the range, population reduction likely exceeds 30% over the past two generations and predicted into one future generation (with an estimated generation time of 15 years), qualifying it for Vulnerable status (VU&#160;A2bcd+4bcd).&#160;<em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> was last assessed in 1996, as Near Threatened.</p>","Based on available literature, <em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> appears to utilize nearly any freshwater body in its range, but with a strong emphasis on small, seasonal ponds, puddles and marshes with high productivity and amphibian aggregations (overview by Gramentz 2008). In northern Ghana (Mole National Park), the species occurs along the Nyanga River (F. Petrozzi and M. Di Vittorio, unpubl. data), and in central Nigeria (Lokoja) both along the Niger and the Benue Rivers (Luiselli and Akani, unpubl. data). In Ivory Coast (Comoé National Park) and Bénin (Pendjari National Park) adults inhabit predominantly large permanent ponds as well as deeper, relatively calm parts in riverine forests within the savanna zone (but in shaded waters where they can be observed basking); whereas hatchlings and juveniles may be found far from these habitats in temporary savannah waters (Rödel and Grabow 1995). Both adults and hatchlings have been observed to migrate larger distances across land (Rödel and Grabow 1995; M.-O. Rödel and J. Penner, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The diet of <em>C. senegalensis</em> is not well known, but amphibians, particularly tadpoles, and fish, are known to be a significant food source, while larger animals appear morphologically adapted for feeding on freshwater clams and snails (Gramentz 2008). <em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> rarely exceeds 35 cm straight carapace length (SCL), at which size it weighs just under 5 kg (Gramentz 2008), but Trape <em>et al</em>. (2012) stated it could reach 60 cm in SCL. Size and age at maturity and longevity appear unrecorded; by analogy with other medium-sized Trionychid species inhabiting seasonal waterbodies, a generation time of 15 years is estimated. Clutch sizes of 6 to 25 eggs have been indicated in the literature. Hatchlings measure less than 45 mm SCL (review by Gramentz 2008).","<p>Whether the widespread collection and subsistence consumption of <em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> translates to significant impacts on local or global populations has not been documented. Being specialized to take advantage of both permanent and seasonal water bodies in a biome where rainfall patterns are shifting as a result of global climate change, this species may be at particular risk, both directly as well as (and predominantly) indirectly, through shifting agricultural and land use patterns and water usage. Alternatively, construction of local ponds and reservoirs may conceivably create new habitat for the species.<br/></p>","<p>Anecdotal information suggests that the species can be abundant in suitable locations, although given the seasonal dynamics of its preferred pond habitat, such observations may be based on occasional aggregations and concentrations of animals from wide areas (overview by Gramentz 2008). It is suspected to have disappeared from many localities within its wide range. In Nigeria, the species is mostly uncommon (although still widespread in the southwest) and with apparently fragmented populations; it occurs with relatively abundant populations only in a few water bodies inside well-preserved Guinea savannah areas (Akani, Luiselli, Eniang, unpubl. data). In Togo, it is not common and is found only in the northern Sudanese savannah region, with a few populations recorded from Kundja Konkomba, Mango, Kara, and Mandouri, and interviews with local people suggests that it should be present also in the Djambé Nature Reserve. Population sizes are declining in Togo (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014). There has been a range contraction in Senegal; historically in the north, and continuing in the Senegal river. In the trans-boundary National Park W at the Benin-Niger border area, it remains locally common (Chirio 2009). In Ivory Coast (Comoé National Park) and Bénin (Pendjari National Park) the species has been regularly observed but is rare (Rödel and Grabow 1995; M.-O. Rödel and J. Penner, unpubl. data). The species occurs in the wetlands of South Sudan, where its populations are probably still relatively unaffected, and it has been recorded in the Gambela region of western Ethiopia.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> ranges through most of the sub-Saharan Sahel-Savannah zone, including southern Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan, and Ethiopia. It may also occur peripherally in adjacent Guinea, and conceivably in northern Uganda. It has also recently been recorded in Sierra Leone (U. Fritz, unpubl. data). It possibly occurred in southern Mauritania in past times, but has disappeared from northern Senegal and presumably adjacent Mauritania following the construction of the Diama dam. There appear to be three large disjunct populations: one in West Africa from Senegal to western Nigeria; one in central Africa from Lake Tchad to northern Central African Republic; and one in eastern Africa in Sudan and South Sudan extending into western Ethiopia.<br/></p>","<p><em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> is widely collected for local subsistence consumption and traded at local markets (summary by Gramentz 2008).

The species is also traded in the international pet trade, at low to modest numbers.<br/></p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<p>Currently <em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis </em>is not protected or regulated under international legislation.

Monitoring and possible regulation of collection, local consumption trade, and the heretofore somewhat limited international trade of this species appears warranted.

Its populations in Israel are small and fragmented, and considered Critically Endangered (under criterion C2a). In Egypt, the species has disappeared from the Nile below Lake Nasser. Populations in Central Africa are indicated to be in mild decline, while populations in northeastern Africa are understood to be stable. The Turkish population is expanding its range and is locally common; it may be threatened in Turkey but more information is needed. Overall, on balance this species has likely experienced well over 30% total population decline over its past two generations as a result of targeted exploitation and habitat degradation, and this trend is likely to continue, qualifying the species as Vulnerable based on criteria A4bcd. The West African populations likely warrant regional listing as Critically Endangered.<br/><br/><em>Trionyx triunguis</em> was previously (1996) listed as Least Concern globally in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, and because it was considered unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. It has long been recognized as a threatened species in the Mediterranean region; the Mediterranean population (Israel, Lebanon, Syria?, Turkey) was assessed as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a in 1996 by the IUCN SSC European Reptile and Amphibian Specialist Group.&#160;</p>","<p><em>Trionyx triunguis</em> inhabits fairly deep water in permanent lakes, rivers, estuaries, coastal lagoons and coastal waters, down to 80 m depth. It is highly tolerant of full seawater conditions for some time (Branch 1988, Baran and Atatur 1998, Taşkavak and Akçınar 2009). In Nigeria, it occurs in brackish water creeks and rivers, with mangroves (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000). May use hot springs in Turkey. In Israel the quality of the habitat, and availability of nesting sites, varies with river fluctuations. It ranges from below sea-level to over 1,500 m (in Africa). In West Africa it is found in both savanna and forested zones (Trape&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2012). It is found along the seashore in Angola and at the mouths of larger rivers.<br/><br/><em>Trionyx</em> feeds on a variety of animal prey (molluscs, insects, crustaceans, frogs, fish), carrion, and vegetarian items (palm nuts, fruits) (Branch 1988, Gramentz 1993, Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Akani <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>Large<em> Trionyx triunguis </em>have been recorded at 83 cm SCL and 33 kg weight (Gramentz 2005), 96 cm in Gabon (Pauwels <em>et al</em>. 2017), and a specimen with 108 cm SCL was&#160;caught&#160;in a bottom trawl in&#160;the ocean at&#160;55 m depth at Iskenderun Bay, Turkey&#160;(Taskavak and Akçınar 2009). Females produce clutches averaging about 30–40 eggs (but exceptionally up to 60–90 eggs) in exposed sandbanks and banks with heavier soil along rivers (Branch 1988, Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002, Gramentz 2005, Türkozan unpubl. data)&#160;and marine beaches (Türkozan <em>et al</em>. 2006). The SCL of hatchlings is about 45 mm with a mass of 11.6 g (Türkozan <em>et al</em>. 2006). Age at maturity and clutch frequency are unreported (Gramentz 2005). Captive animals have reached over 50 years of age (Branch 2008). For purposes of this assessment, generation time was estimated as at least 20 years.</p><p></p><p></p>","<p><em>Trionyx triunguis</em> is widely collected for consumption in the Sub-Saharan part of its distribution, mainly at local subsistence level (Branch 1988, Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is also hunted by fishermen for the bushmeat trade in West Africa (for instance, in southern Nigeria: Akani <em>et al</em>. 2001), but the trade level remains low because this species is very rarely encountered in the field. Nonetheless, the meat is highly valued, and the prices are considerable (G.C. Akani, E.A. Eniang, L. Luiselli, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Animals caught by fishermen may be killed, and nests destroyed, as perceived competitors (e.g., in Turkey: Gramentz (1990), Baran and Atatur (1998)). Bycatch mortality in trawlers off the Çukurova delta (Seyhan, Ceyhan and Berdan rivers) on the coast of Turkey has been reported&#160;(Oruc <em>et al</em>. 1997). Boat traffic and water pollution, especially in Dalyan region, has impacted the rate of reproduction and increased the probability of boat collisions; fox predation is the main threat in the main breeding areas, and there is a slightly decreasing trend in nest numbers (O. Türkozan unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Habitat destruction, in particular for tourist and residential developments, is considered a significant threat in at least the Mediterranean part of the species’ range. While construction of dams has been detrimental to <em>Rafetus euphraticus</em>&#160;softshells in Turkey, dam construction has been beneficial to&#160;<em>T. triunguis</em> in Egypt (Baha El Din pers. comm.). In the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria, this species is locally threatened by oil spills, and tends to completely disappear when its natural habitat is being polluted (Luiselli and Akani 2003, Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;</p>","<p>Limited population data are available through most of the range of <em>Trionyx triunguis</em>.<br/><br/>In Turkey the species occurs in two main areas: the Cukurova delta (Seyhan River mouth) in the south and Dalyan and the Dalaman area in the southwest. In addition, reproduction occurs at seven more sites (Aksu/Acisu, Anamur, Goksu, Berdan River, Tuzla Drainage Channel, Karatas Drainage Channel, and at least formerly, Ceyhan River); recent records indicate that small populations may exist at a few more sites (Patara, Fethiye, Kopru Cayi/Acisu, Bozyazi, Orontes (Asi) River) (Gramentz 2005). All populations are under serious threat, but the one at Cukurova faces the highest pressure, especially from fisheries activity.<br/><br/>A previous nesting&#160;record from Lebanon (Demirayak <em>et al</em>. 2002)&#160;suggests that nesting may&#160;still occur there.<br/><br/>In Israel a robust population is known from the Alexander River. Introduced individuals are known from seven tributaries in the Hula Basin (part of the inland Jordan River system), with reproduction taking place occasionally and hatchlings being captured and moved to the native, coastal rivers (Werner 2016).<br/><br/>The recent status of Egyptian populations is unknown; it is considered to have disappeared downstream of the Aswan Dam, representing most of the historical Egyptian range. A survey of the Nile Delta and its lagoons suggested that it might now be extirpated there (with the possible exception of Bardawill Lake) (Nada 2002). South of the Aswan dam it is fairly common in Lake Nasser with large specimens frequently caught (Baha El Din pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The species is considered fairly common in Sudan, while no population data are available for South Sudan.&#160;The species is occasionally caught by fishermen and adults and eggs may be consumed locally; turtles were not seen at the fish landings or in markets in Bor or Juba (P. Baker pers. obs.).&#160;Waterfalls and strong rapids may be a barrier to its distribution in the Upper Nile. In Ethiopia, the species does not appear to occur in Lake Tana (the source of the Blue Nile) for this reason, although specimens from there have previously been reported, possibly representing traded or introduced animals.<br/><br/>The species is considered fairly common in Sudan in the main stem of the Nile and in its major tributaries. No current population data are available for South Sudan; however, habitats in its historic range are largely intact. The species is occasionally caught by fishermen, and adults and eggs may be consumed locally; turtles were not seen at the fish landings or in markets in Bor or Juba (P. Baker pers. obs.). &#160;In Ethiopia, <em>Trionyx</em> have been observed in the Tekeze River and the Blue Nile, but does not appear to occur in Lake Tana (elevation = 1788 m),&#160;although specimens from there have previously been reported, possibly representing traded or introduced animals, as the ca. 40 m high Blue Nile Falls likely poses a barrier to natural migration to the lake.&#160; Disjunct populations of <em>Trionyx</em> may be found in rivers that flow into Kenya (Omo River) and Somalia (Shabelle River).<br/><br/>The situation in East Africa is unclear and more information is needed, although the species is understood not to be exploited where it occurs and available habitat is good. In Uganda, <em>Trionyx</em> are known from Lake Albert and possibly Lake Edward; however, waterfalls (e.g., Murchison Falls) and strong rapids may be a barrier to its distribution in the Upper Nile. This species has not been observed in Lake Victoria.<br/><br/>In Kenya,&#160;<em>Trionyx triunguis</em> is restricted to Lake Turkana and possibly Turkwel River; oil exploration occurs in that region and the desert environment poses a challenge for management of the water resources on which the species depends.&#160;Hydroelectric dams on the major rivers that enter Lake Turkana may impact water levels in the lake and further isolate populations.&#160;No population is known in Tanzania.<br/><br/>West African populations from Senegal to Nigeria are considered to be rare and threatened; likely the species was never common in the past, when, in some regularly monitored sites,&#160;2-4 specimens/month were reported, now only one is recorded approximately every three years. These populations need urgent assessments for status and demography analyses.<br/><br/>In Senegal, only three records are known; it is hard to find evidence of the species.<br/><br/>In Liberia the species was uncommon in the past and is now very difficult to find.<br/><br/>The species is confirmed from Niamey in the Niger River basin and probably occurs throughout the river basin. Occurrence in the transboundary Parc W, in the Niger basin, is confirmed. Fishermen of the Bozo tribe recognize two kinds of softshells, said to have been very common once upon a time, now very rare, but still present (L. Chirio pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Togo, this species was first recorded by Matschie (1893) and Tornier (1901). However, these authors reported for its presence the locality of Kété Kratchi, which is currently situated in Ghana. Recently, this species was found in Sokodé area, and another specimen reportedly originating from Togo was observed at a reptile farm located in Lomé (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Nigeria, the species is rare, and inhabits only brackish water rivers with mangroves along the banks (Rivers and Bayelsa States; Stubbs Creek Reserve in Akwa-Ibom State), and enters freshwater tracts along the Cross River. It has also been recorded in Cross River National Park (E. Eniang and L. Luiselli unpubl. data).&#160;In Nigeria, it generally occurs at the wide mouth of big rivers and in wide lakes, lagoons and waterbodies.<br/><br/>In Gabon <em>Trionyx triunguis</em> is considered quite common. It is known from Akanda, Ivindo, Loango, Mayumba,  Minkebe, and Moukalaba national parks (Vande weghe <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Angola and Namibia, the southern limit of the species is reached in the mouth of the Cunene River, between Namibia and Angola. &#160;It was first recorded from Namibia by Penrith (1971); Griffin (2003) noted that the&#160;species nests at Foz du Cunene, perhaps accounting for reports of Green Turtles (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>) nesting there (Hughes <em>et al</em>. 1973). A single specimen is known from Olushandja dam, but this animal was possibly imported from Angola (C. Eyre pers. comm.). <em>Trionyx</em> is common at the Cunene River mouth and is frequently hooked by fisheries biologists. Animals are occasionally seen in the adjacent sea, but their occurrence and distribution upstream and along the coast is unknown. Besides the Olushandja specimen, only two other Namibian specimens exist (Penrith 1971), and a specimen in the Möwe Bay Museum from Torra Bay. This species also occurs in the Skeleton Coast Park.<br/><br/>Few recent records for Angola include specimens from “the mouth of the river Cunene and its surroundings, in the Cuio region near the mouth of the Coporolo River, on the river Cuanza where I saw nests about 100 km upstream of the mouth, and in the bay of Luanda where a few dozen animals feed. Additionally I have a record of a dead male in the Palmeirinhas region” (Michel Morais, in litt. to WR Branch).&#160; Another large dead adult was recorded on the beach at Soyo, on the southern bank of the Congo River Mouth (W. Klein in litt. to W.R. Branch).<br/><br/>On balance, while the populations and trends in the Mediterranean are relatively well known and offer cause for concern, populations in West Africa and as far south as Angola are poorly known. Large rivers and suitable habitat are few (rapids on the Congo River preclude occupation of the Congo Basin) and populations in the rivers of West Africa are all subject to human population growth and habitat degradation. There is no justification for considering that the remnant West African populations meaningfully protect the species globally.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Trionyx triunguis</em> ranges widely in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. It occurs in the coastal regions of southern Turkey from Dalyan to Asi River, and in the Mediterranean coastal area of Israel from Tel Aviv northwards (Werner 2016). Records from Lebanon are known but current occurrence is uncertain. It has not been recorded from Syria, although vagrants probably occur there. Vagrants have been recorded from the Mediterranean coast as far north and west as Kos, Greece (Taskavak <em>et al</em>. 1999, Taskavak and Akçınar 2007). <em>Trionyx triunguis</em> has been successfully introduced into the Jordan River system in the north of Israel, including the remaining wetlands of Hula Lake (Werner 2016). &#160;In Africa, <em>Trionyx</em> occurs in the Nile River basin from Egypt upstream, in river basins in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Kenya, and in coastal and inland river systems from the Senegal (Mauritania-Senegal) River throughout the Guinean forest zone of southern West Africa, including&#160;the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, and Lake Chad,&#160;and with records extending from southern Central African Republic to the Cunene River on the Angola-Namibia border, including many localities in Gabon and some in Republic of Congo (Iverson 1992; Branch 1988, 2008; Boycott and Bourquin 2000; Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002; Trape&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2012). Insufficient survey data are available to conclude whether the species is continuously distributed across these regions or occurs primarily in particular, restricted and fragmented areas only; the range is not connected between Lake Turkana and Somalia, but there is a possible record from the Somalia border region of Kenya. This species also has a scattered distribution along the southern coasts of West Africa (G. Segniagbeto and L. Luiselli <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). Historically,&#160;<em>Trionyx</em> was known from the lower Nile below the Aswan Dam, but it is considered to be extinct there now (Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002).</p>","<p><em>Trionyx triunguis</em> is widely collected for consumption in the Sub-Saharan part of its distribution, mainly at local subsistence level (Branch 1988, Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is also hunted by fishermen for the bushmeat trade in West Africa (for instance, in southern Nigeria; Akani <em>et al</em>. 2001), but the trade level remains low because this species is very rarely encountered in the field. Nonetheless, the meat is highly valued, and the prices are considerable (G.C. Akani, E.A. Eniang, L. Luiselli unpubl. data). Large parts of the range are in areas predominantly occupied by Muslim communities, for whom this species is unsuitable for consumption.<br/><br/>Hatchlings are occasionally sold as pets. Trade data: 1987-2010: 1544 traded. 70% declared as wild-captured exported from Ghana and Togo, imported mainly by EU countries, United States and Japan. Peak declared trade volume was 400-500 animals 1992, in most years about 100, some 200 in 2009.</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p><em>Trionyx triunguis</em><em>&#160;</em>was listed on Appendix II by CITES in 2016, in addition to all other African softshells; the&#160;population in Ghana was also included in CITES Appendix III from 1976 to 2007. As far as can be ascertained, <em>T. triunguis</em> is fully protected from exploitation under the national wildlife laws of Congo, Cote D’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Israel, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Turkey, as well as being under partial protection in Chad (collection under permit only) and Ghana (trade is prohibited); legislative protective status for other countries could not be determined.<br/><br/>The Dalyan (Turkey) population is a tourist attraction, where marine turtle protection measures assist <em>Trionyx</em>. Livelihood alternatives in the form of turtle tourism is in place in Dalyan, and the practices merit expansion to other areas.&#160;There have been ongoing reproductive ecology study since 2006 in Seyhan River and Dalyan in Turkey.&#160;The species is actively managed and maintained in the wild in Israel.&#160;<em>Trionyx triunguis</em> has been recorded from at least three protected areas in Egypt (Baha El Din pers. comm.). Awareness of the species' ecology may help counteract wanton killing by fishermen.<br/><br/>In Turkey a conservation management plan needs to be developed and implemented. In West Africa, urgent conservation measures are needed. Conservation measures will likely need to be focused on maintaining all significant populations, defined by geography / river basin as well as any lineages recovered through molecular phylogeny. Better data on distribution, population status and trends, and information on threats and conservation actions, are required from across the range of the species.</p><p><br/></p><p>&#160;</p>",Afrotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Four more specimens were subsequently collected and stored in Chinese collections, one of these in 1940 (Parham <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004, Zhou and Zhao 2004, Blanck 2005). Commercial turtle collectors and traders have extensively harvested turtles throughout China (Lau and Shi 2000), and extensive but unsuccessful search efforts had been made to locate <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cuora yunnanensis</span> in the wild or in trade. Based on this information, the Asian Turtle Trade Working Group (2000) considered the species extinct. However, a single animal, without data on its origin, was purchased in a Kunming market in 2004 (Zhou and Zhao 2004), showing that this conclusion was premature. At least two animals have subsequently been reported and are held in captivity (Zhou 2005, He <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Yang and Rao 2008). There were initial concerns that the single 2004 animal could have been a hybrid animal that resembled <span style=""font-style: italic;"">yunnanensis</span> in its head and throat pattern, but not its absence of an anal notch; however, the identity of the live animals as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">yunnanensis</span> was genetically confirmed by He <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2007).",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">C. yunnanensis</span> has been reported only from Kunming Fu and Tongchuan Fu [=Dongchuan <span style=""font-style: italic;"">fide</span> Iverson, 1992, but refers to Zhongping (=Huize) City <span style=""font-style: italic;"">fide</span> Blanck <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006] in Yunnan, China, at the time of its 1906 description (Iverson 1992, Parham <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2004), and a single animal from Xi Shan (Western Mountains) near Kunming collected in 1940 (Zhang and Cheng 1946).

There is consistent documentation of declining abundance throughout much, but not all, of the species' range, but this is insufficiently quantified at present.","Inhabits closed forest, forest edges and savanna areas, as well as cay littoral forest; the animals occur from near sea level to about 300 m altitude (Lee 1996, Campbell 1998, Platt <em>et al</em>. 1999). In Belize they reach their greatest abundance in pine forests and open pine savannas (S. Platt in litt. 20 Dec. 2006). The animals are mainly terrestrial and are rarely found in aquatic habitats, although sometimes found around the periphery of wetlands or in marshy or aquatic situations (Lee 1996, Campbell 1998, S. Platt in litt. 20 Dec. 2006).
<br/>Feeds predominantly on fruits and young plant shoots, and may also take some insects (Campbell 1998, Platt <em>et al</em>. 1999). Active mainly during the wet season (Iverson in Groombridge 1982).
<br/>
<br/>Maximum recorded size for females 20.7 cm CL (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2004), males 18.8 cm (Ernst in Smith and Smith 1979). Size and age at maturity have not been reported. Females produce single-egg clutches, rarely two eggs, three or four times during the nesting season of June to August in Guatemala (Campbell 1998). In captivity in Mexico, females produced clutches averaging 3.0 eggs (2 to 4, N=11) during May to July, which hatched after an average of 71 days incubation (range 62 to 78 days, N=11) (Escudero <em>et al</em>. 2006). Longevity has not been reported.","The species was consumed historically by the Mayas and their descendants, and is now heavily hunted for consumption in some areas. <br/> <br/>Campbell (1998) attributed the overall decline of the species in Guatemala to habitat loss due to farming, and to use of these turtles as food. The decline in Tikal National Park was possibly due to tourists taking animals with them, or increased predation rates by coatis whose populations expanded dramatically within the park due to protection. Dry season fires can be an additional impact on animal survival; many of these turtles spend much time below ground in armadillo burrows in the dry season; Platt <em>et al</em>. (2004) speculated that these burrows are important dry season refugia. Coastal and island populations (Cozumel, Turneffe Atoll) may be significantly impacted by habitat degradation and subsidized predators resulting from tourist resort and fishing camp developments (Platt et al., 1999). Natural predation rates appear low (S. Platt in litt. 20 Dec. 2006). <br/> <br/>Road mortality has been reported (Buskirk 1997, S.

In Guatemala, Campbell (1998) noted that the species was formerly quite abundant, but had become scarce by the late 1990s in many areas. He noted that the species was frequently encountered along the trails in Tikal NP until about the mid-1980s, but was much rarer by the late 90s. Considered seemingly rare in Mexico by Smith and Smith (1979). <em>R. areolata</em> was very common in northern Belize in the 1990s; at one study site (of about 100 ha) over 300 animals were marked and not many recaptures were made, indicating a much larger population (S.

<br/>
<br/>An activity period during the rains from early July to middle August was reported for the Sonora desert (Iverson 1989); in adverse years, aestivation grades into hibernation without an activity period at all (Schilde 2001). The animals are active mainly during daylight hours, basking when air temperatures approach 45ºC, and can undertake substantial travels on the desert floor (Iverson 1989).

<br/>
<br/>Females appear to reach maturity at a body size of 12 to 13 cm and 6 to 10 years of age (Iverson 1989). Mating occurs in July, and nesting occurs in July and early August; clutches comprise on average 4.7 eggs (range 1 to 9), and females typically lay two or three clutches. Hatching probably takes place in the next year's rainy season, with an incubation period of about 11 months (Iverson 1989).","The rarity of the species in scientific collections, combined with ongoing extensive modification of the Sonoran desert for ranching, agriculture and flood control, was in the past believed to indicate that the species may be threatened. As a species inhabiting wetlands in an arid region, it is susceptible to climatic impacts and habitat degradation; while adult animals may well be able to survive long periods of adverse conditions, recruitment might only occur in optimal years and as such would be extensively impacted even by minor changes. It is probably locally impacted by road kills. <br/> <br/>However, studies have shown the species to be extremely abundant in suitable habitat throughout a wide area, and the species apparently benefits from pond construction by humans (Iverson 1989). Hence overall it is not considered significantly at risk.","It can occur locally at very high densities: 45 minutes of trapping in one 0.15 ha pond gathered 25 adult animals (translating to a biomass of 58 kg/ha), and additional trapping would probably have caught more turtles (Iverson 1989).

Maximum size of females is 54 cm CL, males maximum 21.6 cm. Maximum longevity is probably well over 30 years (Breckenridge 1955, in Ernst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1994). Females normally produce two clutches per year, nesting mainly in June and July. Clutches usually comprise 12-18 eggs, extremes of clutch size are 4-39 (review by Ernst <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>1994).<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apalone spinifera atra</span>: Restricted to the Cuatro Cienegas basin, an hourglass-shaped intermontane basin of about 50 km long and 8-24 km wide (about 600 km<sup>2</sup>), its floor being at 720 m altitude. Much of the central part of the basin is marshy, with dry sandy slopes leading up the rocky valley slopes. A number of deep (up to several meters) ponds occur within the marshy area, and retain crystal-clear water throughout the year. About half the bottom is covered by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (mainly <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Chara</span>), the other half is bare sediment. Waterlilies grow in the shallow parts, and thick stands of cattails (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Typha</span>) and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Eleocharis</span> fringe the ponds. Water temp is about 27-29 degrees C. Ponds may be separated from dry nesting areas on the slopes by substantial distances (several 100 m.) of flat marshy grassland. (Webb and Legler 1960). Within the basin, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. s. atra</span> has been recorded only within the deep ponds, but not in riverine situations (Webb and Legler 1960, Webb 1962). Limited information of food indicates that the animals feed selectively on aquatic insect larvae (Webb and Legler 1960). Reproductive data on dissected type series (limited to smaller individuals) suggest that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. s. atra</span> matures at similar sizes as other <span style=""font-style: italic;"">spinifera</span> subspecies (Webb and Legler 1960), i.e. males mature at CL over 15 cm, and females at CL over 28 cm. No information is available on clutch size or frequency, on age at maturity, or longevity of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">atra</span>.","While <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apalone spinifera</span> has long been exploited for local consumption (Webb 1962) and more recently for export of adults for food and of hatchlings as pets and for Asian farming operations, and some individuals are destroyed as nuisance by-catch by recreational fishermen, are run over when crossing roads, and populations are affected by pollution, water diversion, and water infrastructure development, the species as a whole is not threatened in its existence by present processes. However, certain subspecies and populations are considered to be less secure.<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apalone spinifera spinifera</span>:&#160; The Lake Champlain and Hudson River valley populations<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>are considered to warrant conservation attention. <br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apalone spinifera atra</span>: Main recorded threat is hybridisation or intergradation with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apalone spinifera emoryi</span>, which entered the Cuatro Cienegas basin from the Rio Grande through the Rio Nadadores and Rio Salado. A number of previously isolated ponds and wetlands had been drained and interconnected by a network of canals before 1960 (probably before 1920) for agricultural purposes (Webb and Legler 1960, Smith and Smith 1979), but apparently not connected to the Rio Chiquito. How <span style=""font-style: italic;"">emoryi</span> transferred from the Rio Nadadores to the isolated ponds is unclear; Webb (1962) considered overland dispersal during rain, subterranean connections, and human transport as possibilities.&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apalone spinifera</span> <span style=""font-style: italic;"">emoryi</span> was present in the Cuatro Cienegas basin as early as 1938-39 (Schmidt and Owens 1944); specimens of both forms collected in 1958 were clearly separable (Webb and Legler 1960) and apparently showed no indication of hybridisation at least 20 years after first contact. However, Webb (1962) subsequently noted that not all <span style=""font-style: italic;"">atra</span> showed all diagnosic characteristics, and that some approached the condition shown in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">emoryi</span>. Within the basin, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">emoryi</span> shows a preference for riverine situations, with only few individuals recorded from ponds (Webb and Legler 1960, Webb 1962). Some trade and consumption of softshell turtles has occurred in the Cuatro Cienegas basin at least in the 1950s (Webb 1962). The survival of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">atra</span> is dependent on the ecological and hydrological integrity of the relatively small Cuatro Cienegas ecosystem. The Cuatro Cienegas basin has been extensively altered in its hydrology by digging canals to supply water to a steel mill in Monclova, and for local agricultural irrigation. Roads, railroads, pipelines and other infrastructure for industrial, logistic and tourism and recreational purposes have impacted the ecosystem, and some of these environmental impacts continue. Roads have created direct-mortality impacts. (Groombridge 1982, and references therein). Provided no further major engineering works impact the ecological integrity of the Cuatro Cienegas basin, and the protected area regulations are adhered to, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">atra</span> has probably surmounted its worst environmental impacts.<span style=""font-style: italic;""><br/><br/>Apalone spinifera emoryi</span>: Populations in Mexico are impacted by water diversion and reduced groundwater levels from irrigation and groundwater pumping.<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apalone spinifera guadalupensis</span>: The status of populations of this Texas endemic are apparently poorly known.","A widespread and generally common species.

97409830,6493,Dermatemys mawii,Critically Endangered,A2abd+4d,2006,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"A very conservative generation time of 10 years is assumed here; this is almost certainly an underestimate, when neither age at maturity nor average longevity are known. By analogy from other large riverine turtles (i.e., <em>Batagur</em>, <em>Podocnemis</em>), generation time is likely longer. Exploitation pressures have been and continue to be very high, with populations having collapsed over recent decades and recovery, where possible, being very slow. Assuming a 10-year generation time and 5% annual offtake (both very conservative estimates), populations would decline by 81.5% after 3 generations; however, reduced recruitment as adults are removed would reduce the population even further. See Detailed Documentation for details of distribution, population trends and impacts of exploitation.","<em>Dermatemys</em> primarily inhabit the larger deeper rivers and oxbow lakes throughout the year. During the rainy season they will enter the flooded forests and travel up smaller river courses to nest. Often as flood waters recede they will become trapped in oxbow lakes until the next rainy season, since they are so poorly designed for terrestrial locomotion. Even though this turtle is a fast swimmer and is capable of swimming up rapids they often concentrate in the deep pools at the bottom of the river during the day (Vogt unpublished data). Well oxygenated water is preferred, as they have highly vascularized papillae in the larynx which enable them to stay underwater indefinitely, drawing water in through the mouth and exhaling through the nostrils. However anaerobic black water oxbow lakes used to hold large concentrations of <em>Dermatemys</em> that are trapped there after the water level of the river recedes in the dry season. Although <em>Dermatemys</em> will use fast-moving sections of rivers, they often seek respite from the current in the calmer parts of deep pools and are found in association with submerged tree trunks imbedded in the river bottom. Larger turtles usually rest on the bottom and sometimes partially imbed themselves if the substrate is soft enough. Small individuals often seek shelter closer to shore, resting partially imbedded in accumulations of detritus and also hidden amongst the branches of submerged trees. During April and May, the dry season, adult <em>Dermatemys</em> congregate in the deeper waterholes, 6 m or more in depth. During this same time of the year juveniles and subadults can be found along the shorelines of smaller tributaries taking refuge within the branches of fallen trees or mounds of accumulated detritus (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979, Polisar 1996, Vogt pers. obs.). Populations in Belize are known to enter estuaries (Moll 1989). Dermatemys is an herbivorous turtle throughout its life (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979, Moll 1989, Vogt unpublished data). It eats a wide variety of aquatic vegetation, fallen leaves and leaf detritus, and fallen fruits from riparian vegetation. Belizean populations are also known to enter estuaries to feed upon mangrove vegetation and sea grasses (Moll 1989). <br/> <br/>Females reach maturity between 34.2–42.0 cm, while males become mature between 32.8-38.5 cm (Polisar 1996, Vogt unpublished data). Females grow larger than males; largest size reported is 60 cm and 22 kg (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979), although none of 567 turtles examined by Polisar (1996) in North-Central Belize during 1989–1990 exceeded 49 cm. No information is available on age at maturity or on longevity. <br/> <br/>Nesting begins during the height of the rainy season from September through December when water levels are at their annual peaks; up to three, exceptionally four, clutches of eggs are laid (Vogt and Flores-Vilela 1992, Polisar 1996). Reports in the literature describing the nesting season as March and April (Lee 1969, Moll 1986a) were based on turtles found in the markets that were most likely holding their eggs for an extended period due to their captive condition. Some females may lay their ultimate clutch for the season in late February or early March, but these are anomalies. Vitellogenesis begins in June and July with oviposition from September to March in the Rio Lacantun in Chiapas (Vogt unpublished data). <br/> <br/>Nests are excavated within 3 m of the shoreline, usually within 1 m (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979), often in saturated soil. Nests are often constructed under an overhanging river bank. Since the nests are scattered along a dynamic shoreline during the rainy season they often go undetected by predators. Often nests are exposed by flood waters creating the misconception that this species of turtle lays its eggs underwater (Vogt unpublished data). The earliest nests of the season are often inundated for weeks at a time with no effect on survivorship. Polisar (1992) documented 80–100% hatching success in eggs subjected to more than 30 days of submersion in water. The physiological mechanisms of this emybryonic diapause need to be investigated further. <br/> <br/>Up to three clutches were laid per year in Chiapas, with clutch size ranging from 6-16 eggs. Incubation time in the laboratory varied from 115–223 days, this variation is attributed to embryonic dormancy. Diapause allows the eggs to remain at an early developmental stage when environmental conditions are not favorable for development, cool temperatures and flood conditions, diapause is broken by drying of the nests and warmer temperatures. Clutches laid over a 4 month time span hatch synchronously, stimulated by moistening of the soil during the first summer rains (Vogt unpublished data). In Belize Polisar (1992) reported 217–300 days between oviposition and hatchling emergence. Vogt and Flores-Villela (1992) reported that incubation temperatures in the laboratory above 28° C produced all females and temperatures of 25–26° C produced males.","<em>D. mawii</em> is perhaps the most endangered species, genus, and family of turtles in Mexico, and possibly elsewhere in its limited range. Currently the greatest threat to this species is the human over-consumption that has driven them to be threatened with extinction. Although some of the habitats where these turtles live have been degraded, over-exploitation started even before habitat degradation. <em>Dermatemys</em> are captured with nets, by free diving and by harpooning. Its sale has been illegal since 1975, but this has not done very much to reduce its capture. In Mexico, <em>Dermatemys</em> sold for up to US$ 10 per large animal (presumably over 10 kg) in 1979 (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979); it is currently valued at over $40 per kg live weight in Villa Hermosa (Syed pers. comm. with PROFEPA wildlife inspectors in Tabasco 2005). In 1980 animals were still seen in the fish markets of Alvarado, Lerdo de Tejada and Minatitlan; today they are not sold openly in local markets. In Alvarado, their meat is frozen for sale and delivery is by request (Vogt pers. obs.). Turtle traders in Veracruz expressed concern about future supplies as long ago as 1970 (Mittermeier in Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979). <em>Dermatemys</em> are traditionally harvested for consumption in many areas of Belize (Moll 1986b, Polisar 1995). <em>Dermatemys</em> is similarily one of the most valued turtles in Peten, Guatemala, because its meat is considered a delicacy; animals continue to be hunted with nets, harpooned or collected by hand. At recent harvest rates, the species is expected to be driven inevitably to extinction (Campbell 1998). In addition, the depletion of Mexican populations and the high demand for the species in Mexico will inevitably invite smuggling from Guatemala and Belize.","In the 1970s populations in Tabasco near Villahermosa were decimated and the professional turtle hunters began to go farther and farther away to find turtles to harvest. Harvest quantities in the 1970s amounted to 1,000–2,000 turtles per lake annually; the species was abundant enough in the Tio Lacantum area, Chiapas, that traders built an airstrip to fly them out to Villahermosa (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979). Tales were told by locals of 100s to a thousand <em>Dermatemys</em> taken in a single day in oxbow lakes along the Rio Lacantun and Lago Palestina near Juarez, Chiapas (Vogt unpublished data). By the 1980s no such large populations remained, and the largest confiscations were rarely over 100 turtles. By 1990 Vogt (pers. obs.) never saw more than 5 animals in one place being held from confiscation or for sale. In the Rio Tsendales, Selva Lacandona, Chiapas, in the 1980s, it was possible to catch 40–45 adults in 5 days of trapping with 20 fyke nets (Vogt unpubished data). By the mid 1990s this population had been decimated by Tabascanian turtle trappers, even though the area was completely within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (Vogt pers. obs.). <br/> <br/>Populations of <em>Dermatemys</em> are now so low in Mexico that recovery is perhaps not possible in most regions. The only viable populations of <em>Dermatemys</em> currently (in 2005) exist in inaccessible areas far from civilization. In the Rio Blanco of Veracruz there exists a recuperating population, with a proportion of subadults to adults that is extremely high. Normally at least 80 per cent of the population consists of adults when the population is not being over harvested (Vogt unpublished data). When there are few adults and few subadults and more hatchlings found than adults the population is in extremely fragile shape. When this population was trapped in the late 1990s it had a majority (80%) of subadults, signifying that the adults had recently been overharvested, but that there was sufficient reproductive stock being produced that the population was judged to be recuperating. How many decades this might take is unknown (Vogt unpublished data). <br/> <br/><em>Dermatemys</em> is legally protected by several laws and international agreements but these regulations have not stopped its capture or consumption, and populations of the species in Mexico have been almost eliminated (Vogt and Flores Villela 1992). In Guatemala the status of the population is not clear (Polisar and Horwich 1994). Moll (1986b) conducted countrywide surveys of river systems inhabited by <em>Dermatemys</em>, and market surveys, in 1983–1984. Polisar (1992) documented population structures in sections of the Belize River exposed to contrasting levels of exploitation, finding adults very scarce in the heavily exploited sections. There are reasonable probabilities that some populations in Belize are now afforded at least partial protection, such as sections of Rio Bravo and Irish Creek, Cox Lagoon, and part of the Sibun River (which is a village-originated Hickatee Conservation Area). While pressures in Belize can be assumed to be high, trends have been less disastrous and declines less rapid than in Mexico. <br/> <br/>In Guatemala the status of the populations are not known (Polisar and Horwich 1994). A herpetofauna survey of Laguna del Tigre, Peten, Guatemala, in April 1999 focused on Morelet's Crocodile but also recorded the occurrence of <em>Dermatemys</em>, though in densities too low to quantify reliably (Castañeda Moya <em>et al</em>. 2000). Further surveys in Guatemala and follow-up evaluations in Belize are a priority. <br/> <br/>It was listed in the 1982 IUCN Amphibia-Reptilia Red Data Book as Vulnerable (Groombridge 1982) and has been considered as a high priority by the IUCN Tortoise &amp; Freshwater Turtle SG in its 1989 action plan; it was uplisted to Endangered in the 1996 IUCN Red List.",Decreasing,"Inhabits the regions within the large rivers from the Papaloapan basin in central Veracruz and along the lowlands of the Usumacinta basin in the States of Tabasco and Chiapas, as well as in Campeche, Mexico, through Belize and the large rivers and lakes of the department of Peten on the Atlantic coast of Guatemala. There are no records for this species in either the State of Yucatan or in the northern part of Quintana Roo (Iverson and Mittermeier 1980, Iverson 1992, Campbell 1998, Vogt unpublished data). (See Figure 1 in the supplementary material for a map of the extent of occurrence).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<em>Dermatemys</em> has been subject to legal protection in Mexico since 1927, as under the Mexican Constitution all natural resources belong to the Nation and can only be exploited with formal authorization/permits. <em>Dermatemys</em> was included in the Mexican Red data list (NOM-059-ECOL 1994) as endangered, making all forms of harvest and exploitation illegal. However, very little is done to enforce the law and few people respect it (Vogt pers. obs.). <br/> <br/>In Belize, there is national legislation (Statutory Instrument No. 55, of April 1993) designed to control the level of harvest and establish some protected populations (Polisar 1994). The efficacy of this legislation needs to be evaluated and the nation-wide status of the species assessed. <br/> <br/><em>Dermatemys</em> is protected under Guatamalan law (Campbell 1998) but exact details are not available. <br/> <br/><em>D. mawii</em> is categorized as a highly protected species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (Code of Federal Regulations, 1987).  <br/> <br/><em>Dermatemys</em> is listed on Appendix II of CITES. <br/> <br/>Laguna La Popotera, Veracruz, Mexico, was designated a RAMSAR site in 2005 with specific hopes of creating the first extensively managed wildlife reserve specifically for <em>Dermatemys</em> (Horne in litt. to TFTSG RLA, 27Jul 05). The species is present in Laguna del Tigre N.P. in Peten, Guatemala, and was recommended as a focal species for park management (Castañeda Moya <em>et al</em>. 2000). <br/> <br/> Currently there are several <em>ex situ</em> populations of this species with which viable breeding colonies can be established in different zoos and farms. Some of these <em>ex situ</em> populations are: Nacajuca, Tabasco, with 880 turtles, La Florida, Veracruz, with 45 turtles, the Veracruz Aquarium with 2 animals, Chicago Zoo with 2 animals, Detroit Zoo with 2 animals, Philadelphia Zoo with 9 specimens, and the Guatemala City Zoo with one animal. <br/> <br/>In 2004 a group for <em>D. mawii</em> conservation was established, proposing a program that includes raising the authorities' and people’s awareness on the species, its captive conservation that includes the genetic management of the captive populations, evaluating the wild populations and their habitat, improved enforcement of existing legal protection, promotion of harvest management measures for sustainable use, and the creation of a reintroduction program. <br/> <br/>In summary, existing protective measures need to be implemented, populations inhabiting protected areas must be watched over carefully, and careful thought must be given to meeting some, if not all, of the intensive commercial demand for the species by sustainable production from farms.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Detailed quantitative range-wide estimates are not available, but overall reduction is likely to have exceeded 80% of habitat and 90% of individuals over the course of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with declines stabilized in many but not all sites at present, and only localized population increases. Due to the species’ highly fragmented occurrence in habitats subject to vegetational succession, intensive management is needed to retain existing populations; creation of alternative sites is challenging; and the species’ low reproductive output (on average under four eggs/year per mature female) and relatively late maturity (about six years) means recovery is a slow gradual process at best. </p>  Based on available data, the Bog Turtle is on the boundary between Endangered and Critically Endangered, since the generation time and thus assessment period are uncertain; at a generation time of 15 years (likely a severe underestimate), an 80% decline in total number of individuals over the past three generations (A2), as well as the past two plus the next generation (A4), appears realistic, qualifying the species as Critically Endangered by criteria A2cd and A4ce.","<em>Glyptemys muhlenbergii</em> is a near-exclusive inhabitant of marsh and swamp habitat away from large water bodies; typical habitats include stream-head sedge meadows, spring-fed sphagnum bogs, fens, and open shrubby swamps, and nearby small streams. In contrast to its vernacular name, the Bog Turtle generally avoids strongly acidic bogs (pH &lt;5.5). As Ernst and Lovich (2009) noted, these are often ecologically ephemeral habitats due to vegetation succession. Bog Turtles have small home ranges, at the order of fractions of a hectare, but moderate-distance movements have been reported travelling both overland and using small streams (Carter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, Pittmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).   <p>Bog Turtles are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a great variety of invertebrate and small vertebrate animal prey as well as seeds, fruits and occasionally other parts of a range of herbs, grasses, sedges and shrubs (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009). </p>  <p>Bog Turtles can reach up to 11.5 cm carapace length (CL) in males, and 9.6 cm CL in females. Size and age at maturity has been reported as about 7–8 cm CL and 4–6 years in males, and half a cm larger and likely a year later in females. Females normally produce a single clutch of 3–4 (range 1–6) eggs; not all females reproduce in any given year. Hatchlings measure on average 26–28 mm CL. Longevity may exceed 30 years; generation time has not been calculated (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009). </p>","<p>Much Bog Turtle habitat has been destroyed by drainage and conversion in recent centuries as its wetland habitat is generally located in optimal agricultural soils and landscapes, processes that continue to some extent into the present. Being often located at the lower edges of intensively farmed lands, sedimentation and agrochemical run-off into wetland habitat is an issue. </p>  <p>The Bog Turtle's range is localized, both at the geographic scale (scattered areas of occurrence with extensive areas where the species is absent from suitable habitat) and at the local landscape scale, where suitable habitat is localized in a mosaic of other habitat types. Fragmentation of habitat has continued with agricultural intensification and optimization, and infrastructure, residential and industrial development. </p>  <p>Within protected wetland habitat areas, vegetation succession by both native plants and invasives can reduce the suitability of wetlands to bog turtles. </p>  <p>While fully protected throughout its range, the Bog Turtle remains in small but high demand in the pet trade by virtue of its small size, attractive colouration and reputed rarity. Because of the small home range size and sensitivity of its wetland habitat, disturbance and habitat trampling are greater concerns for this species than most other turtles.</p>  <p>Road mortality and increased predation of eggs and hatchlings from subsidized raccoons has been indicated.

Degradation, fragmentation and destruction of Box Turtle habitat is widespread, from conversion of rural areas to suburban subdivisions and industrial areas, highways and other infrastructure, to consolidation of small-scale agriculture and timber plantations, and impacts of intentional or accidental vegetation fires, including prescribed burn regimes. Pollution and pesticide effects have been implicated in at least localized population declines, and this has impacted across much of the landscape. <br/><br/>Direct mortality from vehicle strikes, both as roadkill and from agricultural machinery, as well as fire mortality, reduces population density and recruitment potential. Decreased recruitment also results from increased predation, particularly of eggs and juveniles, by subsidized predators (i.e., unnaturally large populations of predators subsidized by easily available resources near human settlements) such as raccoons, foxes, possums, and crows, and possibly boar and dogs; introduced fire ants have also been implicated in Box Turtle population declines.<br/><br/>Intentional removal of large numbers of animals for the domestic and international pet trade has largely ceased, but incidental collection of animals as personal pets and for and 'turtle racing' continues, and amount to very large numbers over time. If returned to native habitat, released pet Box Turtles carry a risk of introducing disease into a native population, and animals from elsewhere represent the threat of genetic pollution. The role of disease in Box Turtle declines is not clear, but ear abscesses are particularly prevalent among Eastern Box Turtles and may indicate underlying stresses.<br/><br/>The overall impact of vegetational and forest succession occurring in much of the eastern United States is not clear, but anecdotal information suggests that while protected woodland areas develop into climax forests which are less suitable for Box Turtles, little new habitat is created or reverted to early successional stages. In certain areas (e.g., Egmont Key), Box Turtles rely on introduced vegetation species for shelter, and management measures to address invasive vegetation could adversely affect an area's suitability for box turtles.<br/><br/>The impact of climate change is not easy to predict, but recent mild winters in the Mid-Atlantic region have led to problems with animals emerging prematurely from hibernation, after which they are injured by subsequent cold periods (Dodd 2001, Farrell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006, Ernst and Lovich 2009.<br/><br/>Habitat loss (from sugarcane plantations, cattle grazing and fire impacts), collection for pet or subsistence consumption, and roadkills have all been recorded as threats to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">T. carolina mexicana</span>.

These impacts are ongoing and unlikely to be stopped and reversed in the foreseeable future. <br/> <br/>The genetic structure of the species indicates that the populations at various sites are largely isolated and the species thus qualifies as fragmented.  <br/>Population surveys indicate a steep decline in the total number of animals, from 148 animals per hectare of suitable habitat in the 1960s (when suitable habitat comprised hundreds of hectares, thus likely well over 10,000 mature animals) to about 2,500 mature animals in total in 2002-2003; at an estimated generation time of 15 years (by analogy with other <em>Terrapene</em> species and observed growth rates in captivity), this is a reduction of over 70% of mature animals in three generations. The species may also qualify under criterion C1, but more robust population studies are needed to confirm this.","The Cuatro Cienegas basin is an hourglass-shaped intermontane basin of about 50 km long and 8 to 24 km wide (about 600 sq. km), its floor being at 720 m altitude. Much of the central part of the basin is marshy (maximum 60 cm water depth), with dry sandy slopes leading up the rocky valley slopes. Many of the marshes and ponds are spring-fed. A number of deep (up to several metres) ponds occur within the marshy area, and retain crystal-clear water throughout the year. About half the bottom is covered by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (mainly <em>Chara</em>), the other half is bare sediment. Waterlilies grow in the shallow parts, and thick stands of cattails (<em>Typha</em>) and <em>Eleocharis</em> fringe the ponds. Water temp is about 27 to 29°C. Ponds may be separated from dry nesting areas on the slopes by substantial distances (several 100 m) of flat marshy grassland. (Webb and Legler 1960). In contrast to other <em>Terrapene</em> species, <em>T. coahuila</em> is fully aquatic. Within the Cuatro Cienegas basin, <em>T. coahuila</em> occurs mainly in the shallow marshy areas, but has also been encountered in the river and clear deep pools (Dodd 2001).
<br/>
<br/><em>T. coahuila</em> is largely a resident species that does not disperse widely, as indicated by both natural history studies of this aquatic species in a desert environment, and the significant differences in genotypic composition of the populations at different sites in pairwise comparisons, indicating limited gene flow between sites (Howeth in litt. 24 Jan 2007).
<br/>
<br/><em>T. coahuila</em> feeds on almost equal proportions of aquatic and wind-blown insects and their larvae (54%) and plant matter (46%) (review by Dodd 2001).
<br/>
<br/>Male Coahuila box turtles can reach up to 16.8 cm CL, females remain a little smaller (Dodd 2001). The size and age at maturity have apparently not been reported.
<br/>
<br/>Average clutch size in captive animals varies between 3.8 and 5.0, and several clutches are produced per year (Tonge 1987, Cerda and Waugh 1992). The maximum reproductive output per female is about 11 eggs per year, but for about one-third of examined females it is as low as 6.8 eggs/year (Brown 1974 in Dodd 2001).","The Cuatro Cienegas basin has been extensively altered in its hydrology by digging canals and groundwater pumping for local and regional agricultural irrigation, and for drinking water (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007, Flores-Villela in litt. 25 Jan 2007, Hendrickson in litt. 27 Feb 2007). The western side of the basin is experiencing particularly rapid aquatic habitat loss; Laguna Grande was completely dry in 2006.  According to current residents of Cuatro Ciénegas, and Dr. Dean Hendrickson, this was the first time anyone had seen it dry (this encompasses at least 50 years, conservatively) (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007). <br/> <br/>In 2002, surveys of box turtle sites by a team including Brown (who studied the species 34 years previously) located the marshes where Brown worked in the 1960s. The survey indicates that the species has disappeared from about 40% of its former extent of occurrence, while remaining wetland areas within the area of occurrence have become less suitable (or unsuitable) as habitat for <em>T. coahuila</em> as a result of desiccation and altered vegetation structure (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007). <br/> <br/>Roads, railroads, pipelines and other infrastructure for industrial, logistic, tourism and recreational purposes have impacted the ecosystem, and some of these environmental impacts continue. In the last decade it is known there has been tourist development, and farming expansion continues (Reuters 2007). Roads and fires have created direct-mortality impacts (Howeth in litt. 24 Jan 2007). There is a potential threat from the global pet trade (at least partly met by captive breeding, see Conservation Actions). Hybridization is not an issue for <em>T. coahuila</em>, in contrast to its sympatric turtle species.","The only available population estimate is that of Brown (1974), who calculated a density of 148 <em>Terrapene</em> per hectare of marsh during 1964-66. By the beginning of the 1990s it was believed to be uncommon, and a mark-recapture study in 2002-2003 of about two thirds of suitable <em>T. coahuila</em> habitat marked about 750 turtles with 50 to 80% recapture rates, extrapolating to a total population size at the order of about 2,500 adult animals (Howeth in litt. 26 Feb 2007).",Decreasing,"Restricted to the Cuatro Ciénegas basin, Coahuila, Mexico (Iverson 1992, Dodd 2001).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Turtles in general are protected from exploitation under Mexican wildlife and natural resource legislation.

Within this restricted range it is subject to progressive human-induced habitat loss through desiccation resulting from water extraction, and human utilization of the land for agriculture and general development.  <br/>The species is potentially subject to hybridization by an invading relative Morphological evidence suggests that hybridization is happening, but the molecular studies have not been done.","The Cuatro Cienegas basin is an hourglass-shaped intermontane basin of about 50 km long and 8 to 24 km wide (about 600 sq. km), its floor being at 720 m altitude. Much of the central part of the basin is marshy, with dry sandy slopes leading up the rocky valley slopes. A number of deep (up to several metres) ponds occur within the marshy area, and retain crystal-clear water throughout the year. About half the bottom is covered by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (mainly <em>Chara</em>), the other half is bare sediment. Waterlilies grow in the shallow parts, and thick stands of cattails (<em>Typha</em>) and <em>Eleocharis</em> fringe the ponds. Water temp is about 27 to 29 degrees C. Ponds may be separated from dry nesting areas on the slopes by substantial distances (several 100 m) of flat marshy grassland. (Webb and Legler 1960).

The advance of this hybridization zone into the Cuatro Cienegas basin could lead to the genetic pollution, dilution and eventual loss of the <em>taylori</em> genotype and taxon. The date of initial contact between the taxa and thus start of hybridization is uncertain, but was probably facilitated by human alteration of the basin’s hydrology before 1920 (Smith and Smith 1979). <br/> <br/>The survival of <em>T. taylori</em> is dependent on the ecological and hydrological integrity of the Cuatro Cienegas ecosystem. The Cuatro Cienegas basin has been extensively altered in its hydrology by digging canals and groundwater pumping for local and regional agricultural irrigation, and for drinking water (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007, Flores-Villela in litt. 25 Jan 2007, Hendrickson in litt. 27 Feb 2007). The western side of the basin is experiencing particularly rapid aquatic habitat loss; Laguna Grande was completely dry in 2006 for the first time in at least 50 years (Howeth in litt 24 Jan 2007). <br/> <br/>Roads, railroads, pipelines and other infrastructure for industrial, tourism and recreational purposes have impacted the ecosystem, and farming expansion continues at the expense of natural habitat (Reuters 2007). Roads have created direct-mortality impacts (Groombridge 1982 and references therein).","In 1960 this was the commonest turtle in the Cuatro Cienegas basin, outnumbering Apalone about five to one (Legler 1960, Webb and Legler 1960).",Decreasing,"Restricted to the Rio Nadadores and isolated ponds within the Cuatro Cienegas basin of Coahuila, Mexico (Smith and Smith 1979, Legler 1990, Iverson 1992, Seidel 2002).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Turtles in general are protected from exploitation under Mexican wildlife and natural resource legislation.

112660985,9402,Gopherus flavomarginatus,Critically Endangered,A4bcd,2018,2017-03-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Bolson Tortoise,&#160;<em>Gopherus flavomarginatus</em>, was listed as Vulnerable in 2007 because it had experienced population declines estimated at that time to amount to up to 50% over the preceding three generations. It experienced high levels of exploitation during the middle of the 20th century, with subsequent lower levels of known exploitation into the early 21st century. For a while the species was considered to be effectively protected from direct exploitation, and most of its extent of occurrence was considered protected by the designation of the Bolson de Mapimi Biosphere Reserve. <a>However, over the last decade it has become clear that subsistence collection for local consumption has continued if not increased, and habitat degradation has accelerated significantly due to increased cattle ranching and agriculture.</a>&#160;About six separate subpopulations persist, currently estimated to comprise fewer than <em>ca</em> 2,500 adults, decreased from the estimate of about 7,000 to 10,000 adults in 2007, collectively occurring over about 6,000 sq. km. Generation time is somewhere between 40 to 60 years. As a result of renewed and heightened threats to animals and their habitats, population densities and projected population sizes in the known remaining populations have decreased markedly, such that if these trends continue, the species' global population will be reduced by at least 80% over the previous two generations and one future generation. As a result the species now qualifies as Critically Endangered under criterion A4bcd.","<em>Gopherus flavomarginatus</em> is the largest North American tortoise species, approaching 40 cm in carapace length (CL) (fossils indicate past size was more than double this). Females are <em>ca</em> 14–15% larger than males (McCoy <em>et al</em>. 2014, Wiese and Hillard 2015). Sexual maturity occurs at CL over 30 cm and anywhere from about 14 to 20 years of age (Germano 1994, McCoy <em>et al</em>. 2014). Females outnumber males, at male/female ratios of 0.43 to 0.83 in different populations. Wild females produce one or two annual clutches (average 1.3) each averaging 5.4 eggs (McCoy <em>et al</em>. 2014); infertility rate averages 33%, so each female produces on average of 4.6 fertile eggs annually (Adest <em>et al</em>. 1989). However, nest mortality from predation is about 87%, so only about six living hatchlings are produced over 10 years&#160;(Adest <em>et al</em>. 1989). Hatchling mortality during the first year is about 64% (Tom 1994), and hatchling and juvenile survivorship over the first few years is approximately 5%, so an average female will thus produce less than a single subadult offspring in a 10-year period of her reproductive life.<br/><br/>Bolson Tortoises prefer low grade slopes (0.5% to 2%) of fine textured soil (averaging 48% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay, 10% gravel), vegetated by mixed sclerophyll shrub and desert bunchgrass. These areas generally fringe basin floodplains. The area of occurrence is between 1,000 and 1,400 m altitude (Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989). Bolson Tortoises are exclusively herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, shrubs and herbs (Morafka 1982, Morafka&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>Bolson Tortoises dig burrows up to 8 m long and 2 m deep as refuges from predators and extremes of weather conditions, and surface activity is correlated with rainfall and temperature. Aguirre <em>et al</em>. (1989) calculated that adult Bolson Tortoises spend less than 1% of their entire lives on the surface, either basking or feeding along well-established trails near the burrow. Burrows are constructed in social aggregations, and clusters show social structuring of individuals (Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989, Becerra-López <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Radio-tracked juveniles preferred to excavate (or opportunistically use) burrows under <em>Opuntia</em> cacti (Tom 1994).","The extreme reduction of the range of <em>Gopherus flavomarginatus</em> in geological time from the Pleistocene through the early 20th Century has been attributed to a combination of climatic change, seismic activity <a>eliminating whole populations by collapsing burrows</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, and over-exploitation by paleo-indians (Morafka<em>&#160;</em><em>et al</em>. 1989, Truett and Phillips 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>In recent decades, Bolson Tortoises have been over-exploited for food by local residents (particularly resettled people in 'ejidos') and by railroad workers during the 1940s; tortoises were also previously collected and shipped by rail to coastal Pacific cities for gourmet consumption. Tortoises have been absent from a 10 km strip on either side of the railroad, and along roads, for decades (Morafka&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1989). A recent survey (Palomo-Ramos unpubl. data) found that 56 of 81 people interviewed in the range of the tortoise (but outside the Bolson de Mapimi Biosphere Reserve) had eaten them at some time in their lives, indicating that local consumption remains an important source of adult mortality.&#160; &#160;&#160;<br/><br/>Other ongoing threats include habitat degradation and destruction through overgrazing by cattle which has contributed to lost grassland habitats and the extirpation of tortoise colonies <span class=""MsoCommentReference"">and reduced juvenile survival with resultant decreased recruitment (Morafka&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1989;&#160;Becerra-López&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017a,b;&#160;Palomo-Ramos and Kiester unpubl. data).

Three subpopulations represent moderately large reproducing subpopulations, and three further minor subpopulations exist. Total number of adults was estimated at a maximum of 7,000 to 10,000 in 1988 (Bury <em>et al</em>. 1988, based in part on Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 1984); they also divided the range of the tortoise into six districts and provided a list of known localities. Only in the last five years have efforts been made to revisit these localities and update population estimates. Recent revisits to 19 historic sites found that four no longer supported any tortoises and that three had increasing agricultural development that would soon extirpate the local populations. The total population is currently (2017) estimated to be 2,500 with approximately 2,000 within the Biosphere Reserve and another 500 in the remainder of the range (Becerra-López <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Ureña-Aranda <em>et al.</em> 2015, Palomo-Ramos and Kiester unpubl. data). Maximum known density in the 1980s was seven animals per hectare (Bury <em>et al</em>. 1988), but current density is estimated to be at the order of 1–2&#160; animals per hectare (Becerra-López <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Ureña-Aranda <em>et al</em>. 2015, Palomo-Ramos and Kiester unpubl. data). Thus, the total population has declined from an estimated 7,000-10,000 adults in 1998 to about 2,500 adults in 2017, a 64–75% decline over 30 years (less than one generation).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<em>Gopherus flavomarginatus</em> occurs&#160;restricted to a series of disjunct isolated basins collectively known as the Bolson de Mapimi at the junction of southeastern Chihuahua, western Coahuila, and northern Durango, Mexico (Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 1984, Bury&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1988, Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989; Iverson 1992, TTWG 2017). <br/> <br/>The Bolson de Mapimi covers about 40,000 sq. km; the total geographic range of <em>G. flavomarginatus</em> measures about 150 km across, and the area of occupancy is about 6,000 sq. km, but only 700 sq. km when adjusted for habitat type (Morafka 1982, Bury&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1988, Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989).  <br/><br/>The past distribution of the species was much wider; Pleistocene and Holocene fossils indicate occurrence in southwestern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, USA (Strain 1966 [as&#160;<em>G. huecoensis</em> †], Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989, Truett and Phillips 2009, TEWG 2015).","<p>Bolson Tortoises are kept as pets in Mexico and there is local trade in them (Fitzgerald<em>&#160;</em><em>et al</em>. 2004, Gibbons and Goode unpubl. data). A potentially much more serious illegal trade could develop if Bolson Tortoises are added to the existing growing illegal pet turtle trade originating from Mexico.&#160;</p>",Terrestrial,"<em>Gopherus flavomarginatus</em> was listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act in 1979 (Federal Register 44: 23062-23064), and is considered as an endangered species under Mexican federal wildlife laws issued by the Ministry of Social Development (SEMARNAT 2010)<sup> </sup>due to its limited distribution, habitat destruction, illegal pet trade and human consumption.&#160; In 2016, the Mexican Government added the Bolson tortoise to the priority species conservation list and developed and action plan for its protection (PACE; Programa de Acción para la Conservación de la Especie). Additionally, the species is included in Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES),&#160;prohibiting any international commercial trade in the species.<br/><br/>The 342,000 hectare Mapimi Biosphere Reserve was created in 1977 primarily to protect this species and its ecosystem. The tortoise population in the Reserve is about 80% of the entire remaining number of this species. Nonetheless, there are threats to the tortoise within the Reserve, mostly due to <a>habitat conversion</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">, changed land use practices, cattle ranching, <a>and local consumption</a>. In 2016 the Turtle Conservancy and HABIO, A.C. purchased a 17,540 hectare ranch&#160;within the Biosphere Reserve to create the Bolson Tortoise Ecosystem Preserve, which gives complete protection to the tortoise not afforded in most of the rest of the Biosphere Reserve.<br/><br/>Some conservation breeding success has occurred in Mexico and headstarted juveniles have been released in the Biosphere Reserve (Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989, Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 1997). In the United States since 2006, the Turner Endangered Species Fund has been successfully breeding this species in New Mexico with the aim of reintroducing it into its former range in New Mexico, Texas and, eventually, Mexico. Over 500 offspring have been produced, and the oldest are now large enough that supervised releases into the wild in New Mexico can be <a>contemplated</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">.

Available information indicates that this species maintains relatively large populations of &gt;10,000 with an extent of occurrence (EOO) &gt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> and an area of occupancy (AOO) of more than 2,000 km<sup>2</sup>. These populations are present in both protected areas and in agricultural landscapes in India and Sri Lanka and as a small subpopulation in Pakistan.&#160;However, studies have shown that the illegal wildlife trade is increasingly targeting this species to meet apparently increasing international demand for use as ‘exotic pets’. In 2014, more than 55,000 individuals were known to have been collected from just one location (comprised of 16 villages) in India during one year alone (D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2015). Extensive conversion of their habitat (scrubland) to less suitable orchards and croplands is likely to reduce populations further in the future. Based on recent past and predicted future declines, a listing of Vulnerable A4cd is proposed given concerns that population reductions of&#160; &gt;30% are likely to occur if this exploitation continues or expands.","Indian Star Tortoises inhabit a variety of dry vegetation types, including scrublands, grasslands, desert edges and agricultural landscapes of fields, hedgerows and plantations (de Silva 2003; Fyfe 2007). Most localities occur under 200 m altitude, but records from 450 m and even as high as 900 m have been reported (Andrews, pers. comm., 2005). In Sri Lanka, this species occurs throughout the dry habitats up to 270 m altitude (Rathnayake, pers. comm., 2005). Indian Star Tortoises feed mainly on a variety of grasses, herbaceous, succulent vegetation and fruits supplemented with some animal matter (Das 1991; de Silva 2003).&#160;Choudhury and Rao (2005) recorded several species of indigenous plant that were preferred by Indian Star Tortoises in a soft release site in Andhra Pradesh.&#160;Adult males typically reach up to 26 cm and adult females typically up to 32 cm in carapace length (Moll 1989). Females attain sexual maturity at around 6-7 years of age (possibly earlier) (Das 1991; Vyas, pers. comm., 2005). However, in captivity this may be attained by the age of three years (Choudhury, pers. comm., 2005). Nesting seasons coincide with the monsoons that vary depending on the geographic location (e.g., May to June in western India, March to June and October to January in southeastern India) (Das 2002). Annually, females typically produce two clutches (exceptionally up to four clutches) comprising 2-10 eggs (exceptionally up to 24 eggs; Andrews, Choudhury, Vyas, pers. comm., 2005). Generation time has been estimated to be around 10 years (Choudhury, pers. comm., 2005). A detailed overview of natural history is presented by Das (2002), de Silva (2003), and Fyfe (2007).","Threats to this species survival include illegal collection and habitat loss (WWF 1994; Sekhar 2004; Anand 2005; Fyfe 2007; Vyas 2010). “Illegal collection” can be subdivided into two further categories: collection for utilization by local people and collection for the international wildlife trade (D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Locally, in rural areas, tortoises are sometimes eaten for subsistence. However they are also kept as pets in many homes, their owners believing that they bring good luck and fortune (e.g. Anand, 2005). Over 100 hatchlings have been observed in one urban household in India alone (D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2015). In addition, for many people the Star Tortoise plays an even more spiritual role in some societies as they are thought to represent a&#160;reincarnation of the Hindu God “Vishnu” (D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160; In 2015, researchers observed a total of 22 animals at three different Shiva temples in the state of Gujarat, India (D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>However, it is illegal collection for the international wildlife trade that is of most major concern.&#160;Widespread collection and export occurs for local and global pet trade, mainly to Malaysia (Shepherd <em>et al</em>., 2004), Singapore and Thailand, as well as other countries in Southeast and East Asia. Das (1989) estimated an annual turn-over of 10,000 animals in Calcutta’s New Market alone in the late 1970s, before enforcement of domestic legislation nearly eliminated this domestic trade. Export trade seems to have developed into the replacement trade outlet (Choudhury and Bhupathy 1993); by 1993, about 5000 tortoises were estimated as illegally exported. A recent conservative estimate of annual pet-trade export is 10,000 to 20,000 animals, and four confiscated shipments in 2002-2003 comprised between 305 and 1090 animals per shipment (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2004). Most of the pet trade involves small to medium-sized animals, few exceeding 10 cm CL. D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. (2015) reported the illegal collection of at least 55,000 (mostly juvenile) tortoises from just one location (comprising 16 villages) from the state of Andhra Pradesh in India over a period of one year. This figure is three to six times larger than the 10,000–20,000 individuals previously estimated to be poached throughout the entire range of this species each year (Sekhar <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>There are concerns that this species is being illegally smuggled from India (and Sri Lanka) into pet markets in Asia, Europe and the United States (de Silva 2003; Horne <em>et al</em>. 2012; Vyas 2015). However, the majority of animals appear to be destined for use as exotic pets in Asian countries, such as Thailand and China (Shepherd <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004; D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2015). This species was the most frequent illegally traded tortoise seized by Thai authorities between 2008 and 2013 (5966 individuals during 15 cases) and is the most commonly observed tortoise at the infamous Chatuchak Market in Thailand (Chng 2014).<br/><br/>Habitat loss is occurring throughout the species' range; scrub forest habitat is being converted to orchards and cash crop agriculture, leading to reduction of available area of the preferred habitat type. Although this is a relatively adaptable species, able to tolerate anthropogenically altered habitat, continued habitat loss is likely to further impact wild numbers.&#160;<p></p>","<p>This species naturally inhabits scrub forests, grasslands, and some coastal scrublands of arid and semi-arid regions throughout its wide range (Das 2002), but also commonly inhabits &#160;human-dominated landscapes (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2000; de Silva 2003).&#160;Frazier (in Das 1991) recorded estimated densities of 4-12.5 animals per hectare in Gujarat. Populations in Sri Lanka are also generally considered common, although the 1998 Sri Lankan CAMP Assessment noted the species as declining and rated it Vulnerable A2cd. Any populations in Pakistan appear to be extremely localized and small (Moll 1983, 1989).</p>",Decreasing,"Indian Star Tortoises are found in three broadly disjunct (and likely taxonomically recognizable; Gaur <em>et al</em>. 2006) areas of geographic occurrence: northwestern India (Gujarat, Rajasthan) and adjoining southeastern Pakistan; eastern and southern areas from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and eastern Karnataka to Odisha (Orissa); and throughout Sri Lanka (Iverson 1992; Das 1991, 2002; Vyas and Parasharya 2000;&#160;Fyfe 2007;&#160;Vyas 2010).","<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Illegal collection for the international wildlife trade is of most major concern.&#160;Widespread collection and export occurs for local and global pet trade, mainly to Malaysia (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2004), Singapore and Thailand, as well as other countries in Southeast and East Asia.

Consequently, international trade in specimens can take place if an export permit or re-export permit is acquired (CITES 2015). However, to safeguard its wild populations, India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan had chosen to adopt stricter domestic measures than CITES (WWF 1994). For example, the species was placed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and for over 40 years it has been illegal to possess and commercially trade this species either within or from India (Sekhar 2004). However, threat perceptions from illegal trade seem to have substantially increased over this period and there is a case for upgrading the species to Schedule II.&#160;The Forest, Environment and Wildlife Department of the Government of  Sindh, Pakistan through a notification issued on September 2014,  included <em>Geochelone elegans</em> along with other chelonian species of Pakistan in Schedule II (Protected Animals) of Sindh Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1972.<br/><br/>However, there are concerns that legislation in other Asian countries is being exploited to facilitate illegal wildlife trade (Nijman and Shepherd 2015; D’Cruze <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). For example, this tortoise is not currently protected under Thailand’s Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act (WARPA) making it difficult for enforcement authorities to distinguish illegally traded wild sourced individuals from those that have been legally bred in captivity. As such review of existing legislation relating to the commercial use of this species in key consumer countries is warranted.<br/><br/>Given the scale and apparently increasing nature of illegal collection for international wildlife trade, increased cooperation between relevant national enforcement bodies in collaboration with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ Wildlife Enforcement Network (ASEAN-WEN) is also required. However, this enforcement activity should be accompanied by targeted public awareness initiatives that address the increasing consumer demand.<br/><br/><em>Geochelone elegans</em> has been recorded from Sasan Gir NP (Gujarat), Chinnar WLS (Kerala), Jaisamand WLS (Rajasthan), Marine NP, Kalakkad WLS, Mudumalai WLS, and Point Callimere WLS (Tamil Nadu) in India (Das, 1995; Hanfee, 1999),&#160;in all terrestrial protected areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in Peninsular India (Choudhury, pers. comm.) and from Yala NP, Bundala NP, Dimbulagala, Giritale and Wilpattu NP in Sri Lanka (de Silva <em>et al</em>. 2000).<br/><br/>In addition, more detailed quantitative research should be carried out in order to establish the impact that this unregulated activity is having on wild populations of this species in range countries. In light of continued habitat loss, status information and monitoring of populations throughout their range, particularly inside protected areas, is also urgently needed. To aid this activity, a taxonomic review of variability between various populations of Indian Star Tortoises (and Burmese Stars) also seems warranted (Gaur <em>et al</em>. 2006; Fyfe 2007).&#160;<p></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

Trade volumes have collapsed in recent years and field surveys indicate the species to be rare; an estimated population collapse of over 90% over the past 60 years (three generations, at 20 years per generation time), and predicted to continue for the next 20 years, is likely an underestimate. The species qualifies for listing as&#160;Critically Endangered (CR) under criteria A2bd and A4bd.&#160;<em>Cuora bourreti</em> was part of the assessment of <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> as CR in 2000, at that time being considered a subspecies.","<p><em><span lang=""EN-GB"">Cuora bourreti</em><span lang=""EN-GB""> inhabits upland, moist, closed-canopy evergreen forest, usually between 300 and 700 m altitude. The species is predominantly terrestrial and is not specifically associated with forest streams (Stuart and Platt 2004, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2011; McCormack unpubl. data).&#160;<em>Cuora bourreti</em> is a medium-sized turtle, reaching up to 19-20 cm carapace length at a weight of about 800 to 1,200 grams. Males and females reach about the same size. Hatchlings measure about 45–50 mm and weigh 15–24 g. Extremely little is known of the biology of <em>C. bourreti</em> in the wild; most observations on diet, growth, and reproduction derive from animals maintained in captivity, either close to the species’ natural range, or in artificially manipulated captive conditions such as terrariums. Slow growth to maturity (10–15 yrs) is combined with low fecundity; in captivity a single clutch of 1–3 large eggs (55 x 30 mm) is seen each year in Cuc Phuong National Park where a small group is maintained (McCormack unpubl. data; T. Blanck unpubl. data). Similar clutch sizes of 1–3 eggs have been reported from long-term captive animals kept in Europe and North America (Fiebig and Lehr 2000, Struijk 2010).&#160;</span></p>","The primary threat to <em>Cuora bourreti</em> is collection for trade. The species is in high demand in the international pet trade and the Asian consumption trade. Collection efforts include both targeted searches for turtles involving trained dogs, or occasionally pitfall traps, as well as capitalizing on casual turtle encounters when collecting other forest products. Turtles, of any species, are collected whenever and wherever encountered in the region, regardless of legal protection status or location inside protected areas. Collected turtles are traded, mostly illegally, through a network of local middlemen before being exported or consumed locally. Increasing economic value has ensured that hunting pressure is sustained despite the increasing rarity of the species (Hendrie 2000, Stuart and Timmins 2000, McCormack <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2011). Habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but more localized threat to the species.","No absolute population size numbers or estimates are available for <em>Cuora bourreti</em>, and only anecdotal relative population density data. All recent indications are that the species requires extensive search effort to encounter. During field surveys in Lao PDR in 1993–1999, encounter rates were on the order of one turtle per three months in the field for a herpetologist, and one <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> per day when working with a trained turtle hunting dog in prime turtle habitat (Stuart and Timmins 2000). A great deal of survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009–2012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for the&#160;<em>C. galbinifrons</em>&#160;group<em>, </em>with a focus on <em>C. bourreti </em>and <em>C. picturata.</em> Anecdotal information from interviews throughout the range has found that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while the species was common 7–15 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. During surveys in 2006 in and around Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Quang Nam province, local hunters at that time claimed that numbers of <em>C. bourreti </em>had already been seriously depleted, from being able to catch 20 animals a day in the in the mid 1990s to only a few animals a week by 2006. However, the increasing economic value of the species by 2012 to an average of US$15.00 per kg is an increase from 2006, when surveys found an average value of US$9.00 around Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Quang Nam province. Similar reports of reductions in wild populations, and corresponding increases in wholesale prices paid, have been documented during interviews throughout the species range in Viet Nam (McCormack,&#160;unpubl. data). Most specimens end in the Chinese pet and TCM trade, where the species currently reaches prices of $150, compared to $20 in 2005.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Cuora bourreti</em> is known from central Viet Nam (Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Thua Thien-Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, and Kon Tum provinces), as well as from adjoining Savannakhet Province in Lao PDR (Obst and Reimann 1994, Nguyen <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2011).","Historically <em>Cuora bourreti </em>has been consumed locally for food as part of a subsistence diet; however, in the last decade consumption has largely ceased, with most animals now sold into the trade due to the high economic incentive. Juvenile animals are often kept at the village level in attempts to raise them to sell on into the trade (often unsuccessful, with animals dying). The species does not have specific local medicinal uses,<em> </em>but bones are often sold to traders for production of bone glue. In some areas turtles of all species are consumed as broad “health invigorators”. The <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> group represents the second most valuable type of turtle in trade in Viet Nam and Lao PDR after the <em>C. trifasciata</em> complex.&#160;The UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database records a total of 2377 live specimens and 17 specimens of&#160;<em>Cuora galbinifrons</em>&#160;as net and gross exports during the period 1998–2014.&#160;The UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database does not specify subspecies; thus its data cannot be used to elucidate trends in the trade of <em>C.</em>&#160;<em>galbinifrons</em> sensu stricto, <em>C.&#160;</em><em>bourreti</em> or <em>C.</em>&#160;<em>picturata</em>. Searches of internet fora and bulletin boards occasionally yields offers of <em>C. bourreti </em>for sale, often claimed to be bred in captivity; the veracity of such claims is often difficult to confirm without contacting the studbook keeper. All turtle shells are bought in Viet Nam by traders to make into a generic bone glue, plastrons are normally preferred. In some areas shell fragments are discarded. In many areas shells considered beautiful are kept as household decorations. Visible trade in <em>C. galbinifrons</em> at Hanoi’s principal wildlife market, Don Xuan, stopped by about 2006 due to better market enforcement. Prior to this, dozens of <em>C. galbinifrons, </em>including<em> </em>the taxon <em>bourreti, </em>were regularly available each week, these were often juvenile animals and intended for the pet market, not food.

A zero quota was imposed for <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> (including <em>bourreti</em> and <em>picturata</em> as subspecies) at CoP16 (CoP16 Prop.32), effective 12 June 2013.&#160;<em>Cuora bourreti</em> is protected from commercial exploitation in Viet Nam as a Priority Protected Rare, Precious and Endangered Species under Decree 160/2013/ND-CP of the Government.

Documented trade volumes indicate a collapse of populations over the past three decades of over 90% which is extrapolated back to cover the past 60 years (three generations), and collection pressure for the last remaining individuals is likely to continue if not increase in the next 20 years. The species therefore qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered (CR).&#160;<em>Cuora picturata</em> was assessed in 2000 as Critically Endangered as part of <em>Cuora galbinifrons,</em> of which it was considered a subspecies at that time.","The only habitat details available in the literature are based on the locations of nine animals in three surveyed localities: these animals were encountered on the forest floor of broadleaf evergreen forest mixed with bamboo forest, at altitudes between 346 and 561 m elevation (Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011; Blanck <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<em>Cuora picturata</em> is a medium-sized turtle, reaching at least 19 cm carapace length at a weight of up to 1100 grams (Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011; Blanck, unpubl. data). Males and females reach about the same size. Hatchlings measure about 45–50 mm and weigh 15–24 g. Extremely little is known of the biology of <em>C.</em><em>&#160;picturata</em> in the wild; most observations on diet, growth and reproduction derive from animals maintained in captivity, either within or close to the species’ natural range, or in artificially manipulated captive conditions such as terrariums. Mature females of&#160;<em>C. picturata</em> can produce a single clutch of 1–3 eggs each year, with large eggs&#160;measuring up to 60 x 35 mm (Blanck, unpubl. data).","<p>The primary threat to <em>Cuora picturata</em> is collection for trade. The species is in high demand in the international pet trade and the Asian consumption trade. Collection efforts are targeted and occur mainly as searches for turtles involving trained dogs. Turtles, of any species, are collected whenever and wherever encountered in the region, regardless of legal protection status or location inside protected areas. Collected turtles are traded, mostly illegally, through a network of local middlemen before being exported or consumed locally. Increasing economic value has ensured that hunting pressure is sustained despite the increasing rarity of the species (Hendrie 2000; McCormack <em>et al</em>. 2010; Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011). Habitat loss and degradation are considered a significant but more localized threat to the species (Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;                  Large areas of forest on the Langbian Plateau are being rapidly converted to coffee plantations and other agricultural lands. Only one of the three localities where <em>C. picturata</em> was found (Deo Ca Protected Forest) was protected at the time (Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011). Most animals end in the Chinese pet and TCM trade. Current prices in China are $150 for an adult, compared to $20 in 2005.</p>                 <p></p>","<p>Population density of <em>Cuora picturata</em> is considered to be low. Ly <em>et al</em>. (2011) carried out field surveys throughout representative periods of the year, and required 15 days of a 4-person team with three trained hunting dogs (60 man-days, or 480 man-hours; 45 dog days or 360 dog hours) to encounter eight turtles, translating to 60 man-hours and/or 45 dog-hours per turtle. During a field survey in May 2012 in Deo Ca–Hon Nua Special Use Forest (a traditional collecting area in Phu Yen province, Viet Nam), a team of five dogs (four local hunting dogs and one trained survey dog) found only a single <em>C. picturata </em>and two <em>C. mouhotii </em>during a week of searching in which dogs were actively used over 21.7 km of transects (McCormack, unpubl. data; Blanck <em>et al</em>. 2016). Assuming that a team of dogs works a strip of a minimum width of 100 m, and finds half of all exposed and hidden turtles, this calculates to an estimated density of less than one<em> C. picturata </em>per sq. km, or one turtle per 280 dog hours. A great deal of survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009–2012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for the <em>C. galbinifrons</em> group<em>, </em>with a focus on <em>C. bourreti </em>and <em>C. picturata.</em> Anecdotal information from interviews concluded that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while these box turtles were common 7–15 years ago, they are now increasingly difficult to find. The overall extent of occurrence (EOO) of <em>C. picturata</em> is less than 25,000 sq. km, of which much is likely unsuitable as a result of being below or above suitable altitude, as well as large areas of                  suitable habitat at suitable elevation having been converted to agricultural purposes.&#160;The remaining area with suitable habitat (area of occupancy) for the species (AOO) is only about 3,000 km².&#160;The global surviving wild population is probably below 25,000 individuals, likely&#160;no more than 3,000-10,000 at best.</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Cuora picturata</em> is apparently restricted to the eastern slopes of the Langbian Plateau, being known only from Khanh Hoa and southern Phu Yen provinces of southern Viet Nam (Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011; Struijk and Blanck 2016; Blanck <em>et al</em>. 2016). May also occur in eastern Dac Lac and northern Ninh Thuan provinces.&#160;By analogy with the biogeography of better-surveyed syntopic primates, Ly <em>et al</em>. (2011) postulated that the <em>Cuora galbinifrons-bourreti-picturata</em> group inhabits three discrete, disjunct hill forest areas, of which the range of <em>C. picturata</em> matches that of&#160;the Yellow-cheeked Gibbon (<em>Hylobates gabriellae</em>) and Black-shanked Douc Langur (<em>Pygathrix nigripes</em>)&#160;in being restricted to the eastern slopes of the Langbian Plateau. This region covers an area of less than 250 x 100 km (25,000 sq. km).&#160;<em><span lang=""EN-GB"">Cuora picturata</em><span lang=""EN-GB""> was originally, at the time of its description in the late 1990s, speculated to possibly occur in eastern Cambodia, as no confirmed field localities were known and specimens only showed up in turtle trade in southern Viet Nam, at points known to be part of the trade routes from Cambodia to Viet Nam and onwards. However, surveys in Cambodia have failed to find any indication of the species there, while the discovery of wild specimens on the Langbian Plateau&#160;(Ly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011) explains how specimens would be part of turtle trade in southern Viet Nam.</span></p>","<p>Historically <em>Cuora picturata </em>has been consumed locally for food as part of a subsistence diet; in the last decade, however, consumption has largely ceased with most animals now sold into the trade due to the high economic incentive.

The UNEP-WCMC CITES Trade Database records a total of 2,377 live specimens and 17 specimens of <em>C. galbinifrons</em> as net and gross exports during the period 1998–2014.

115650943,10241,Chersobius signatus,Endangered,A4ace,2018,2017-06-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>  </p>  <p>We base our assessment of&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;signatus</em> on documented population reductions in the past and projected reductions into the future (A4). We estimate a population reduction of at least 30-40% over the past 25-50 years (1-2 generations) due to anthropogenic land transformation and other threats, where the causes of destruction have not ceased. The reduction in population size is based on surveys that showed habitat destruction and degradation, fragmentation, and the extirpation of populations, a decline in area of occupancy (AOO) and habitat quality, as well as an increase in predation by invasive Pied Crows. These declines are expected to be amplified by climate change. Predictions of climate change are that the western Succulent Karoo would persist under all scenarios, but temperatures will increase and rainfall decrease, causing an increase in aridity (Bourne <em>et al</em>. 2012). Loehr <em>et al</em>. (2007, 2009, 2011) demonstrated that the expected changes in rainfall pattern and temperature across the range are likely to affect growth rates and fecundity of <em>C. signatus</em> females, and consequently the survival of the species. When considering the past and projected future changes together, the decline in population size is projected to be in excess of 50%, qualifying the species as Endangered under criteria A4ace. Another contributing factor to population declines is that local populations become increasingly fragmented due to the extirpation of many populations and destruction of connecting terrain between their preferred rocky outcrop habitats.</p>  <p></p>","<p>                      </p><p><em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;occurs predominantly in the winter rainfall region of the northwestern Succulent Karoo and Fynbos biomes along the West Coast and adjacent inland of South Africa. It is found from a few metres above sea level on the West Coast to elevations of around 1,000 m in the interior at Springbok, Loeriesfontein-Calvinia, and the Cederberg Range (Boycott 1989). The species shows a particular preference for rocky terrain (Loehr 2002a), which includes typical Namaqualand and Hardeveld granite koppies in the north, and typical Sandveld and Cederberg sandstone koppies and rocky ridges in the south. It occurs in low to medium-high Namaqualand succulent blomveld and heuweltjieveld, and fynbos and strandveld shrub vegetation, both in the Succulent Karoo and Fynbos biomes. The species prefers to shelter in rock crevices or under medium to large boulders and rock slabs (Loehr 2002a), a behavior that provides protection to these small tortoises against temperature extremes (Loehr 2017b) and predation.&#160;<em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;has very small home ranges (average 3,470 square meters = 0.35 ha) and short daily movement distances (30-50 m) compared to other tortoises (Loehr 2015).<br/><br/><em>Chersobius signatus</em> is a very small tortoise species: straight carapace lengths are 52-110 mm and 52-96 mm for females and males, respectively. Growth rates are higher for juveniles and females than for males, but growth rates are low and affected by rainfall. Females need 11-12 years to mature, which is substantially longer than expected for such a small tortoise (Loehr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007a). <a>Generation time is estimated as 25 years</a>. During years of drought, individuals have low body conditions (Loehr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007b) and experience negative growth (they can shrink), which holds serious consequences for female fecundity if the occurrences of drought intensify in the future (Loehr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009). Females produce one large egg (up to 11.9% of body volume) at a time and may lay more than one clutch during their nesting season in the spring. Rainfall influences egg production and fewer females are gravid in years of low rainfall (Loehr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/><em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;feeds on a broad range of plant species, which includes the flowers, leaves, and stems of forbs, grasses, succulents, and shrubs (Loehr 2002b, 2006). A 15-year study at a small site within a larger area with suitable habitat near Springbok indicated that the population consisted of <a></a><a></a><a>transient</a>&#160;and resident individuals, with a relatively high survival rate for adults, but slightly lower survival for females than for males (Loehr 2010, 2017a). It appeared that periodic droughts did not directly influence survival of juveniles and adults (Loehr 2010).&#160;<em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;basks for long periods to maintain relatively high body temperatures in the winter and spring, the time of the year when food is abundant. Females appear to have higher body temperature than males through most of the year, possibly to enhance follicle and egg development in winter and spring (Loehr 2012).</p><p></p>","The main threat to&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;signatus</em> is habitat destruction and degradation. Observations and focused research throughout its known range indicate that this species is intolerant of habitat modification. Severe habitat fragmentation has resulted from extensive agricultural development throughout the range and especially in the Sandveld region. This includes the irreversible alteration of the inter-koppie (small hill) habitat—a zone that probably plays an important role in inter-population gene flow and recolonization of koppies that have lost their populations. Overgrazing by domestic stock, especially goats, further degrades and threatens remaining natural koppie and surrounding habitats, whereas an increase in mining activity has transformed sections of the coastland (see Bourne <em>et al</em>. 2012). Increased predation by Pied Crows poses a threat for which the extent remains to be determined (Loehr 2017a). There is illegal collection for export to the international pet trade, although this is infrequent. Climate change predictions are that most of the western Succulent Karoo would experience increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall, causing an increase in aridity (Bourne <em>et al</em>. 2012). Loehr <em>et al</em>. (2007, 2009, 2011) demonstrated that the expected changes in rainfall pattern and temperature across the range are likely to have a negative effect on growth rates and fecundity of individuals, and consequently the survival of the species.","<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;signatus</em> has a relatively small distribution and was previously known to be common in some areas. However, a long-term study in an area where the species used to be common showed that the resident population declined by 66% from 2000 to 2015, possibly due, in part, to increased predation by Pied Crows (Loehr 2017a). Field surveys in the early 2000s demonstrated the decline and finally extirpation of the species in many localities of its southwestern range, where it used to be common (E. Baard and M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.). The latter decline can be ascribed to substantial degradation of the habitat (Rouget <em>et al</em>. 2004), which has continued (Schoeman <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to overgrazing of the koppie habitats and transformation of the plains between the koppies. By virtue of the rock-dwelling behavior and specific habitat requirements (Loehr 2002a, 2012), and the small home ranges and short daily movement distances of the species (Loehr 2015), populations are highly fragmented, particularly in regions where low-lying habitat has been transformed. Population densities in most areas over the range of the species are low, and local populations are subjected to intense Pied Crow predation at several localities (M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.). The population near Pofadder requires further study to assess its extent and status.<br/><br/>In 2008, CapeNature and associates (University of the Western Cape) launched extensive surveys to update the population status of&#160;<em>C. signatus</em>&#160;in the southern and western part of its distribution range in the Western Cape Province. After visiting 22 localities where the species was known or suspected to occur, its presence was confirmed at 12 sites, including four new sites. These surveys indicated that the species was extirpated in some localities that previously had high population numbers and that extensive habitat degradation and destruction was placing remaining local populations under great threat (E. Baard 2015, unpubl. report to Turtle Conservation Fund). A follow-up survey by M.D. Hofmeyr (unpubl. data) showed that at least two more subpopulations in this southwestern region were extirpated within a short time period; the sites were overgrazed by goats with clear evidence of predation by Pied Crows.<br/><br/>Intermittent surveys in the northern range of the species between 2000 and 2015 (32 days) discovered only one site with a viable population; only one shell was recovered at another site (V. Loehr pers. obs.). Similarly, surveys above the escarpment (2000 to 2016) showed that the species is highly habitat-specific and usually occurs in low numbers (Hofmeyr unpubl. data). Over the range of the species, the frequency of predation by Pied Crows is increasing (Cunningham <em>et al</em>. 2016). The increased level of predation likely explains why a high-density population near Springbok declined by 66% over a 15-year period.",Decreasing,"<em>Chersobius signatus</em> is endemic to South Africa, occurring mainly along the West Coast region of the Western Cape and Northern Cape, from Piketberg and around Citrusdal in the south, northwards across the Olifants River into the Namaqualand Hardeveld to the Springbok-Steinkopf area. Eastwards, the distribution reaches as far inland as the Klipwerf-Loeriesfontein-Calvinia area of the Roggeveld-Bokkeveld region in the Northern Cape. The most northerly records are from the Richtersveld (Bauer and Branch 2001) and from just north of Pofadder (Branch <em>et al. </em>2007). Griffin (2003) did not substantiate any <em>C. signatus </em>records from Namibia, including a record from the Fish River Canyon Park (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). Earlier records of this species from Namibia (Mertens 1955, 1971) are referable to <em>C. solus</em> (Branch 2007).",Some illegal off-take has taken place during the past decades for the pet trade.

The species occurs in low densities in two national parks (Richtersveld and Namaqua), and in the Oorlogskloof and Goegap nature reserves, and Cederberg wilderness area. Population numbers in Goegap are low with approximately one sighting every five years. There is a small-scale conservation breeding program in Europe under the auspices of the Homopus Research Foundation and the European Studbook Foundation.&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;signatus</em> was listed as Restricted by Boycott (1988) and as Lower Risk/near threatened in the 1996 IUCN Red List. The status was changed to Vulnerable in 2014 (Baard and Hofmeyr 2014), mainly due to human-induced habitat degradation and destruction, and the international reptile pet trade. Further research is required to assess population status, habitat conditions, land transformation and threats throughout the species’ range and to ensure that it has sufficient representation within protected areas. A conservation stewardship arrangement should be encouraged to include more natural habitat in formal conservation arrangements, and measures to stop illegal collecting for the pet trade need to be strengthened.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The remaining 85% of its natural habitat includes Kruger National Park, where <em>K. lobatsiana</em> does not occur. Consequently, degradation of this species’ habitat would be in excess of 15% in Limpopo and even higher in Gauteng Province. Changes in habitat availability are due mainly to agricultural conversion, urban development, and mining activities (Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012, Schoeman <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2013), with alien species invasion representing another threat (Rouget <em>et al</em>. 2004). The use of mechanical bush clearing and fire as management tools are particularly destructive (Mifsud and Stapleton 2014). Another factor that compromises the species’ survival is its strong association with rocky hillsides and outcrops, which isolate local populations when the plains and valleys that link their preferred habitat are degraded and destroyed. Although legal trade appears to be low, there is evidence that all <em>Kinixys </em>species are collected for food, cultural purposes, and the pet trade, which can cause local extinctions (Mifsud and Stapleton 2014). We estimate that at least 20 to 25% of the species’ habitat has been destroyed or degraded over the past 35-40 years (1.5 generations) and that this figure would reach 30-40% over the next 1.5-generation span. Based on past and future loss to the species’ habitat we infer a population reduction in excess of 30% and consider the species Vulnerable based on criterion A4cde.","<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em> is a savanna species that inhabits rocky hillsides in habitats of mixed <em>Acacia</em> and <em>Combretum</em> woodland, tropical Bushveld and Thornveld where vegetation ranges from dense, short shrubland to open tree savanna (Broadley 1989, Branch 2008, Boycott 2014). The species is sympatric with <em>K. spekii</em> over most of its range.&#160;<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em>&#160;is omnivorous and apart from feeding on herbaceous plants, fruits and mushrooms, its diet includes beetles, snails, and millipedes (Branch 2008). Activity is highest during the summer rainfall season and it appears to brumate in abandoned animal burrows or rock crevices in winter (Branch 2008). In captivity, mating has been observed in summer and nesting in early autumn, with females having up to six eggs per clutch (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). The species is sexually dimorphic with females being larger and heavier than males (max. carapace length 200 versus 170 mm and max. body mass 1,500 versus 820 g; Boycott and Bourquin 2000). The elongated shell is dorso-ventrally flattened and the carapace has a broken rayed pattern (often absent in males) on a buff to brown background (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Branch 2008). Broadley (1993)&#160;commented that South African&#160;<em>K. lobatsiana</em>&#160;have more distinct markings than tortoises from southeastern Botswana.","<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em>&#160;faces a number of threats, the most important being habitat destruction and degradation (urbanization, mining, agriculture), inclusive of alien species invasion (Rouget <em>et al</em>. 2004, Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012). A combined soil and rangeland degradation map indicates that degradation severity in the 1990s varied from light to severe over most of the species’ distribution (Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 1999). A subsequent study, evaluating change in land cover between 1994 and 2005, showed extensive deterioration in land cover in the Provinces where this species occurs (Schoeman <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2013). Apart from habitat destruction and degradation, the use of fire as a tool for livestock and biodiversity management has the potential to kill large numbers of tortoises. Additional threats include collection for food and cultural purposes and the international pet trade (legal and illegal), which can cause local extinctions (Mifsud and Stapleton 2014).","There is no direct information currently available on population numbers of <em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em>, but documented loss and degradation of available habitat suggest significant population declines.",Decreasing,"<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em> is near-endemic to South Africa, extending from the northeastern parts of the North West Province, eastwards through northern Gauteng and adjacent parts of Mpumalanga and northwards into Limpopo, south of the Soutpansberg (Broadley and Boycott 2008, TTWG 2017). An easternmost record for the species from Manyeleti Game Reserve in the subtropical Lowveld is believed to represent a translocation from the Bushveld (Broadley 1993). A single record from Waterpoort on the northern side of the Soutpansberg was considered by Broadley (1993) to have been washed through the gorge during a flood, but it could have been transported by human agency. The species also extends slightly into southeastern Botswana to the Lobatse district.",<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em>&#160;is presumed to be actively hunted for consumption and potentially for medicinal and cultural purposes and is known to be collected for the pet trade (Mifsud and Stapleton 2014). Limited data are available on legal trade and no quantitative data are available on hunting pressure locally or regionally.,Terrestrial,"<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em> is included in CITES Appendix II (as Testudinidae spp.) and receives formal protection in Botswana as well as in South Africa. In the latter, it is protected by provincial nature conservation ordinances and biodiversity laws at a regional level, but the species is not protected at a national level by the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act No. 10 of 2004). In South Africa, its range falls within a number of protected areas, such as the Loskop Dam, Ohrigstad Dam, and Nylsvley Nature Reserves (Boycott and Bourquin, 2000). No formal research has been done on this species. Of greatest importance is that the conservation status of populations and their habitat should be assessed, as well as the threats faced by populations in different regions. In addition, research projects that focus on the life history traits, reproductive biology and ecology of the species, should be initiated.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global
115655918,170519,Chersina angulata,Least Concern,,2018,2017-06-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,<em>Chersina angulata</em>&#160;is assessed at this time as Least Concern since it is widespread and common where it occurs. There is no significant trade or utilisation. The species was previously assessed in 2013 (and published in 2017) as Least Concern.,"<em>Chersina angulata</em>&#160;occurs from the coastal plains all along the escarpment to altitudes of 1,200&#160;m on the plateau. Its habitat in fynbos consists of open to dense fire-prone shrubland covered with ericoid and asteraceous shrubs, restios, and grasses. In the east, the range extends into Albany Thicket, which comprises dense semi-succulent and thorny vegetation, including large and small shrubs, geophytes, annuals, and grasses (Hoare <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006). The species does not occur in dense thickets, but high population densities can occur in partially cleared areas (Branch 1989). A large portion of the habitat falls in the Succulent Karoo, which is dominated by dwarf succulent shrubs, with annuals, grasses, and geophytes. It is also found in the dwarf open shrubland of the Nama-Karoo. These tortoises prefer a sandy substratum in which they partially bury themselves when taking refuge under vegetation. Nevertheless, they also occur in rocky areas where they hide under large boulders or among rocks. <em>Chersina angulata </em>is medium-sized (maximum carapace length 35 cm) and distinguishable by its large, undivided gular scute. Its carapace is domed and the dorsal scutes are straw-coloured with dark centres and edges. Males are larger than females, which produce one egg at a time through most of the year (Hofmeyr 2004). Males and females reach sexual maturity at 10-14 years (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data) and can potentially live for 50+ years. The diet is diverse and consists of angiosperms (mostly herbs and grasses), mosses, mushrooms, insects, snail shells, and animal faeces (Branch 1989, Joshua <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2010). Although they are food generalists, they select dietary items out of proportion to availability (Joshua <em>et al</em>. 2010). Their metabolic rate plateaus between 26-38°C, which may indicate a thermal preference for summer foraging in the Eastern Cape (Setlalekgomo and Winter 2016a). The species has an endogenous circadian rhythm, suggesting it can, at least partially, thermoregulate physiologically (Setlalekgomo and Winter 2016b).","The most prevalent threat to <em>Chersina angulata</em> is fire, particularly in open sandy areas where there are few retreats (rock outcrops, hollow logs, animal burrows) in which to shelter (Branch 2008).  In a single wildfire in 2000, a density of 15.4 dead tortoises per hectare was found; when this is  extrapolated to the total area burnt (approximately 18,400 ha), it is conservatively estimated that from 99,000 to 282,000 Angulate Tortoises were killed in this single wildfire (Baard <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2001). Predation by seagulls is not significant, except on Dassen Island, but Pied Crow predation represents a considerable threat, particularly as Pied Crow numbers in the southwestern South Africa are increasing with climate change (Cunningham <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016). Fincham and Lambrechts (2014) reported that 160 and 315 tortoise carapaces, respectively, were found under a single Pied Crow nest in two successive years. Illegal poaching and smuggling occurs (Henen <em>et al</em>. 2013), but the numbers may be low. The species remains the commonest tortoise in the Cape region despite these impacts.","<em>Chersina angulata</em> is common in suitable habitat in South Africa, where it can reach densities of 30-35 individuals/ha (Branch 1984, Van Heezik <em>et al</em>. 1994). Density on islands free of natural predators&#160;(e.g., Dassen Island) can be as high as 100 individuals/ha (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data). Its presence in Namibia is marginal and no information is available on population numbers.",Stable,"<em>Chersina angulata</em> occurs in southern Africa, and is found mainly within South Africa (about 95% of the range), but its distribution extends marginally into southwestern Namibia. In South Africa it occurs from Komga in the Eastern Cape, westwards through most of the Western Cape, and into the western region of the Northern Cape. Its range extends across the Orange River into Namibia, where the species is found in the Sperrgebiet and surroundings, as far north as Lüderitz and Aus; introduced populations have become established further north at Swakopmund and Walvis Bay (Griffin 2003). It also occurs on several offshore islands, reaching high densities on Dassen Island off the southwestern coast of South Africa.","<em>Chersina angulata</em> has been an important source of food since antiquity (Avery <em>et al</em>. 2004). Although the exploitation of tortoises for food is no longer prevalent, the practice continues in some parts of the country.&#160;                  Historically, the shell has been used decoratively in tobacco boxes (B.T. Henen pers. obs.).&#160;The documented export of live animals from South Africa and Namibia, respectively, comprised 1,567 and 16 between 2000 and 2016, and poaching also occurs (Henen <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species is bred in captivity but it is not clear to what extent this contributes to trade.",Terrestrial,"<em>Chersina angulata </em>is included in CITES Appendix II and is protected in South Africa by provincial nature conservation ordinances and biodiversity laws at regional level. Similarly, the species is classified as protected in Namibia, where it is listed as Peripheral (Griffin 2003). In South Africa, <em>C. angulata</em> occurs in eight National Parks and 10 major Nature Reserves spread throughout the range of the species. In Namibia, it occurs in the Ai-Ais/Richtersveld Transfrontier Park, Namib-Naukluft NP and the Sperrgebiet NP (Griffen 2003). No further conservation measures specific to <em>C. angulata</em> appear warranted at present, although general efforts to address increasing threats from Pied Crow predation should be considered.

Relic populations in the southwestern interior are associated with fynbos or renosterveld inclusions in the Succulent Karoo Biome. The species occurs from sea level to elevations of 1,300 m in the interior, and prefers low but dense vegetation that provides protection against temperature extremes and predation. Annual rainfall over its range varies between 300 and 600 mm, but can be as high as 1,200 mm in the south. In the western region, winter rains prevail, but rainfall becomes non-seasonal towards the east.<br/><br/>Age of maturity is estimated as 8–10 years (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data) and longevity can exceed 28 years (Boycott and Bourquin 2000).

Large areas of the southwestern and southern range of the species has been transformed, with little remaining natural habitat (Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012). A future threat is climate change, which will have a large impact on the Fynbos Biome of the southern Cape (Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012, Schoeman <em>et al</em>.<em>&#160;</em>2013). The small size of individuals makes them particularly vulnerable to predation by Pied Crows (Fincham and Lambrechts 2014) and small mammals. Furthermore, an increase in fire frequency decimates populations.&#160;<em>Homopus areolatus</em> is sympatric with <em>Psammobates geometricus</em>&#160;and <em>Chersina angulata</em>&#160;at some sites (M.D. Hofmeyr and B.T.

Most of the western range falls within Critically Endangered or Endangered ecosystems (Rouget <em>et al</em>. 2004), limiting available habitat. In some regions, the species is marginalised to suboptimal habitat (M.

115656360,170521,Chersobius boulengeri,Endangered,A4ace,2018,2017-06-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Extensive surveys by Greig and Burdett (1976) extended the distribution range of&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;boulengeri</em> substantially, which led the authors to propose that the species is not rare, as was previously believed, but that individuals were seldom encountered because they were so well camouflaged. The conservation status of&#160;<em>C. boulengeri</em>&#160;was considered to be Least Concern on the 1996 IUCN Red List (TTWG 2014, 2017), but as possibly Vulnerable at a Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group Red Listing workshop in late 2013. It was subsequently listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2017 based on an earlier 2013 assessment (Hofmeyr and Baard 2014, Bates <em>et al</em>. 2014). Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2017 indicated that most localities (30 of 35) where populations previously occurred no longer harbor viable populations and that the species is no longer being found by farmers. Habitat destruction and degradation maps of South Africa (Hoffman <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999) show that nearly 50% of the range of <em>C. boulengeri</em> is either moderately or severely degraded, which may explain the species’ decline.&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;boulengeri</em> is associated with rocky outcrops in specific vegetation types, qualifying it as a habitat specialist, which increases its risk of extinction. The documented population declines will be exacerbated by the effects of climate change and associated vegetation change. Monitoring over recent decades showed that grasses are invading the Karoo, replacing the dwarf shrubs, with an increasing fire-hazard in the habitat (Stevens <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Nama-Karoo is considered the second most threatened biome in South Africa under all climate scenarios. Predictions are that savanna and desert vegetation will expand into large portions of the current biome (Driver <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2012; DEA 2013). Such changes would intensify grazing pressure by livestock and reduce food and cover for tortoises. Predation by baboons was high at one site visited during surveys (M. Hofmeyr pers. obs.) and crow predation may be on the increase (Juvik and Hofmeyr 2015). A serious new emerging threat involves shale gas exploration and development, which would require  substantial large-scale infrastructure to support the drilling and operation of  wells and extraction sites.  Based on these factors, <em>C. boulengeri</em>&#160;is assessed as Endangered under criterion A4ace, based on an estimate of a reduction in population size of approximately 30% over the past 25 years (one generation), and a projected reduction of at least another 30% over the next 50 years (two generations), for a total reduction over three generations of approximately 60%.</p>","<p><em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;boulengeri</em> occurs in association with dolerite ridges and rocky outcrops of the southern Succulent and Nama Karoo biomes, and peripherally in the Albany Thicket biome in the southeast, at altitudes of approximately 800 to 1,500 m. Annual rainfall is low (approximately 150 to 400 mm over the species’ range) and relatively unpredictable with a coefficient of variation between 35 and 40% (Schulze 1997). Most of the range receives late summer rains. Temperatures are mild to hot and the incidence of frost is high in the interior. Occurs in dwarf shrubland that often contains succulent and grassy elements. The tortoises usually take shelter under rocks in vegetated areas or in rock crevices (Boycott and Bourquin 2000), but few rocky sites over the range offer suitable retreats for the species (V. Loehr and M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.). Females nest in summer and have single-egg clutches (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). No information exists on age at maturity and longevity, but based on the life history of&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;signatus</em>&#160;(Loehr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007), female&#160;<em>C. boulengeri</em>&#160;are expected to mature at 10-12 years of age.</p>","<p>The main past and current threat to&#160;<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;boulengeri</em> appears to be habitat degradation. Drought and agricultural overgrazing also threaten the species' habitat. Climate change maps indicate future changes under all scenarios to habitats in the southern and eastern distribution range of the species (Driver <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2012). Crows and baboons pose another threat because, due to the small size of the species, these predators can exploit adult tortoises. A serious new threat involves shale gas exploration, which would require substantial infrastructure to support the drilling and operation of wells and large-scale extraction sites. </p>","<em>Chersobius boulengeri</em>&#160;is a&#160;habitat specialist and&#160;population densities&#160;are <a>low</a>.

A combined soil and veld degradation index (Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 1999) showed moderate degradation for the taxon’s habitat in the Northern Cape. Bourne <em>et al</em>. (2012) indicated that the Namaqua district (western Northern Cape) experiences multiple impacts from overgrazing, destructive or illegal mining, and unsustainable land use involving ploughing of natural veld for fodder cropping, uncontrolled harvesting of natural products, and irresponsible tourism activities in sensitive areas. The same processes occur in the taxon’s southern habitat in the Western Cape Province, which is severely impacted by cultivation and land degradation (Rouget <em>et al</em>. 2004). Unfortunately, habitat degradation and destruction of the taxon’s sensitive habitat is continuing (Schoeman <em>et al</em>. 2013) and may escalate. Predictions are that climate change will bring an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall, with increased aridity in the western Succulent Karoo (Bourne <em>et al</em>. 2012).

Generation time is estimated at 25-30 years by analogy with similar small dryland tortoises.&#160;Female&#160;<em>P. t. tentorius</em>&#160;in the Karoo have an extended reproductive season from spring to late autumn (October to June); they produce small clutches (1.78 ± 0.63; 1–3 eggs) but produce several clutches (3.7 ± 1.6; 1–6 clutches) in a season as a means of coping with low and unpredictable rainfall (Milton <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2004, Leuteritz and Hofmeyr 2007).&#160;<em>Psammobates t. verroxii</em>&#160;in southern Namibia produces clutches of 1-2 eggs, which take 220 days to incubate (Cunningham <em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Although the reproduction of <em>P. t. trimeni</em>&#160;has not been studied, anecdotal reports indicate that <a>females</a>&#160;produce one egg at a time (Boycott and Bourquin 2000).</p>        <p></p>","Known threats for&#160;<em>Psammobates tentorius</em>&#160;include road mortality, veld fires, <a>electrocution by livestock/game fences</a>, and overgrazing from domestic livestock (Cunningham and Strauss 2005, Cunningham 2006) as well as predation by small carnivores, eagles, honey badgers, goshawks, crows, monitor lizards, and ostriches (Branch 1989, Malan and Branch 1992, Lloyd and Stadler 1998, Visagie 2011). Available information indicates that Pied Crow <em>(Corvus albus)</em> predation on this taxon is increasingly severe, with anthropogenic facilitation of Pied Crows having led to increased abundance in western South Africa over the past three decades (Cunningham <em>et al</em>. 2016), making increased predation on <em>P. t. trimeni</em> highly likely. Trade is low but illegal collection is still likely, particularly for&#160;<em>P. t. trimeni</em>, which is the most colourful subspecies (Cunningham 2006, Branch 2008). Threats are lowest for&#160;<em>P. t. verroxii</em>&#160;because its distribution is wide and mainly in areas with low human density. The range of&#160;<em>P. t. tentorius</em>&#160;is relatively large, but populations in some regions may be threatened by land degradation (Hamann and Tuinder 2012). The range of&#160;<em>P. t. trimeni</em>&#160;is the smallest of all subspecies and more restricted than initially thought after genetic results showed that it does not occur in the eastern parts of Namaqualand (M.D. Hofmeyr and S.R. Daniels unpubl. data). Habitat in the distribution of&#160;<em>P. t. trimeni</em>&#160;is threatened by mining activities (e.g., for diamonds, sand, copper, granite, sandstone, and gypsum), the inevitable expansion of human settlements in such areas, and overgrazing by livestock. Rouget <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;(2004) ranked the Succulent Karoo second highest for mining pressure of the nine terrestrial priority areas identified in South Africa. A combined soil and vegetation degradation index placed the western Northern Cape in the second highest degradation category (Hoffman <em>et al</em>. 1999). Latest climate change predictions show that although the western Succulent Karoo will remain relatively stable, the coast-hugging habitat of&#160;<em>P. t. trimeni</em>&#160;will be impacted under all climate change scenarios (Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012). Overall, threats facing&#160;<em>P. t. trimeni</em>&#160;are high.","Although <em>Psammobates tentorius</em> is widespread, population density is generally low throughout its range (Branch 2008), and populations appear to be declining slowly. Populations of the restricted subspecies&#160;<em>P. t. trimeni</em>&#160;appear to be declining more rapidly than the other subspecies (M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.).",Decreasing,"<em>Psammobates tentorius</em> is restricted to South Africa and Namibia. The distribution ranges of the three recognized subspecies overlap, and there remains some uncertainty about their exact limits. Of the three subspecies, <em>P. t. tentorius</em> occurs furthest to the south, and is morphologically most distinctive in the southeastern portion of its range. Its range extends from Fort Brown in the Eastern Cape to Touws River in the Western Cape. Further north, the range extends to Victoria West and the Kamiesberg Mountains in the Northern Cape. Genetic evaluation has shown that local populations of the northwestern localities (Kamiesberg Mountains) belong to <em>P. t. tentorius</em> instead of&#160;their&#160;traditional assignment to&#160;<em>P. t. trimeni</em>. The distribution of <em>P. t. trimeni</em> is concentrated in the Namaqualand Sandveld and Richtersveld Bioregions and extends peripherally into the Namaqualand Hardeveld Bioregion. Although <em>P. t. trimeni</em> is on record as present in southwestern Namibia (Griffin 2003), its occurrence there has not been verified despite extensive sampling for genetic studies (M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.). <em>Psammobates t. verroxii</em> has a wide distribution throughout the Nama Karoo in the Northern Cape and penetrates the Western Cape and possibly the Eastern Cape peripherally. Its range extends across the Orange River into Namibia, as far north as Mariental (Griffin 2003). Genetic evaluation, however, has shown that populations north and south of the Orange River differ from each other (Hofmeyr <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Because of its small size, <em>Psammobates tentorius</em> is not a significant food source for humans, but like&#160;<em>P. oculifer</em> (Cunningham 2006), historically, its shell may have been used by&#160;indigenous peoples&#160;as decorative snuff containers or storage boxes for personal effects. Between 1981 and 2015, 259 live <em>P. tentorius</em> were recorded in the international trade (96% South African exports) with the majority (72%) being declared as captive bred. The main importing countries were Japan, U.S., and Czech Republic. However, South Africa also imported many scientific specimens from Namibia (UNEP-WCMC 2017). This species fares poorly in captivity (Branch 1989).",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Psammobates tentorius </em>is included in CITES Appendix II and is protected in South Africa by provincial nature conservation ordinances and biodiversity laws at regional level. In Namibia, the Tent Tortoise is protected under the 1975 Nature Conservation Ordinance and the recent Parks and Wildlife Management Act as Vulnerable, Protected Game, and Specially Protected (Cunningham 2006). Tent Tortoises are known to occur in the Karoo National Park, Camdeboo National Park (formerly Karoo Nature Reserve), Anysberg Nature Reserve, Goegap Nature Reserve, Tankwa Karoo National Park, Akkerendam Nature Reserve, Tierberg Karoo Research Centre, and Augrabies Falls National Park in South Africa, and Sperrgebiet, Ai-Ais/Hunsberg reserve and Hardap Recreation Resort in Namibia (Branch 1989, Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Griffin 2003, Leuteritz and Hofmeyr 2007).<br/><br/>Ecological field studies were undertaken for <em>P. t. tentorius </em>on reproduction, movement, diet, and population dynamics in the southern Karoo near Prince Albert, South Africa (Leuteritz and Hofmeyr 2007) and for&#160;<em>P. t. verroxii</em> on clutch size, diet, home range, activity pattern, resting site selection, and orientation in the Nama Karoo of southern Namibia (Cunningham and Simang 2008). Ongoing studies include the taxonomic status of the species complex, as well as distribution ranges and niche modelling of genetic lineages (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data).

115685642,11004,Kinixys natalensis,Vulnerable,A4c,2018,2017-06-13 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p><em>Kinixys&#160;</em><em>natalensis</em>&#160;was considered to be Vulnerable at a Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group Red Listing workshop in 2013 (TTWG 2014), but was listed as Least Concern by Boycott (2014), as published in Bates <em>et al</em>. (2014), based on an earlier 2010 assessment.&#160;The species was previously assessed as Near Threatened on the 1996 IUCN Red List. The range of <em>K. natalensis</em> covers a region where habitat destruction and degradation far exceeds national levels in South Africa. Jewitt <em>et al</em>. (2015) reported that in KwaZulu-Natal 46.4% of the habitat was degraded by 2011, with an average annual degradation rate of 1.2% since 1994. The major drivers of habitat loss are agriculture, timber plantations, urban development, and the construction of dams and mines. Although there are no official figures available for land degradation in Swaziland (now eSwatini<strong>)</strong>, much of the species’ habitat outside protected areas has been cleared for sugarcane and citrus production (R.C. Boycott pers. obs.), which is confirmed by degradation maps of Rouget <em>et al</em>. (2004) and Schoeman<em> et al</em>. (2013). These findings also apply to the species’ habitat outside of Kruger National Park in eastern Mpumalanga and southeastern Limpopo. Apart from habitat loss, the indiscriminate use of fire to transform bushveld into grassland for grazing poses a great threat to tortoises. Changes to the habitat are irreversible and expected to continue into the future. An additional problem is that the species’ association with rocky hillsides and outcrops isolate local populations, particularly when the terrain linking their habitats is destroyed. We estimate that 30-40% of the species’ habitat in South Africa and Swaziland (now eSwatini<strong>)</strong>&#160;has been destroyed or degraded over the past 35-40 years (1.5 generations), and that these processes will continue over the next 1.5-generation span, for a total habitat decrease over three generations of approximately 40–50%. As a result, we assess <em>K. natalensis</em> as at least meeting the requirements for a designation of Vulnerable under criterion A4c, based on habitat loss and degradation of ≥30%, although it could reasonably be considered as Endangered under the same criterion if habitat loss and degradation were shown to be ≥50%.</p>","<p><em>Kinixys natalensis</em> prefers dry rocky habitat in thornveld, valley bushveld, dry thicket or bushveld savanna at elevations between 50 and 1,200 m and is generally absent from coastal regions, deep sand and forest (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Bourquin 2004, Branch 2008, Boycott 2014). It is sympatric with <em>K. zombensis</em> in northern KwaZulu-Natal and with <em>K. spekii </em>in eastern Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces, as well as Swaziland. <em>Kinixys natalensis</em> is relatively small compared to other <em>Kinixys </em>species, with females reaching a shell length of 160 mm compared to 130 mm in males (Branch 2008). This is the only member of the genus that has a tricuspid rather than unicuspid beak (Broadley 1993). Tortoises are active when conditions are humid, overcast, and after rain, but seek shelter under rocks and in the foothills of mountains when inactive (Boycott 2001). There is little information on the biology of wild <em>K. natalensis,&#160;</em>but in captivity mating has been observed in February, followed by nesting, usually two eggs per clutch, in April and hatching in September (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). Hatchlings have a carapace length of approximately 35 mm and a mass of 8 to 10 g (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). The species is omnivorous and feeds on plants and invertebrates (Boycott and Bourquin 2000), and likely on fungi, which is favoured by most <em>Kinixys </em>species. The species is known to brumate in captivity (Boycott and Bourquin 2000) but this may not necessarily be the case in the wild.</p>","<p>The main threats to <em>Kinixys natalensis </em>are habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation due to agriculture, silviculture, dam construction, and urban development (Broadley 1989, Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Branch 2008). The species occupies a small range; thus, any loss in high quality habitat can potentially have a large effect on populations. Habitat over the range of the species was classified as moderately to severely degraded in the 1990s (Hoffman <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1999). The degradation has continued and an evaluation of land cover change between 1994 and 2005 showed extensive deterioration in land cover over the region where this species occurs (Schoeman <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2013, Jewitt <em>et al</em>. 2015). Habitat transformation has also escalated over the past years in the Lebombo Plateau of Swaziland (now eSwatini<strong>)</strong>, and probably also in South Africa, due to cattle ranchers clearing bush to convert arid savanna into grasslands (Boycott 2001). Such habitat degradation increases the risk of hot fires, which were already a threat through the indiscriminate use of veld fires (Broadley 1989, Boycott and Bourquin 2000). Additional threats include collection for food, cultural purposes, and the pet trade. Although the species is present in protected areas, populations tend to be isolated and fragmented, with low densities.</p>","No formal studies have yet been done on <em>Kinixys natalensis</em> and little information is available on the size and conservation status of subpopulations and their habitat. No data are available for Mozambique. In Swaziland (now eSwatini<strong>)</strong>, it is listed as Near Threatened (Monadjem <em>et al</em>. 2003) with <em>K. natalensis</em> considered rare in the Mlawula and Mbuluzi nature reserves in the Lebombos. Two limited surveys indicated an estimated density of one <em>K. natalensis</em> per two hectares in the Mlawula/Mbuluzi complex but due to habitat degradation and loss it is unlikely that this density will apply to the rest of the Lebombos (R.C. Boycott pers. obs.). Similar densities for <em>K. natalensis</em> are probably likely in Itala and Weenen game reserves (R.C. Boycott pers. obs.) but due to extensive habitat degradation&#160;and loss, it is doubtful if viable populations exist outside reserves.",Decreasing,"<p>The range of <em>Kinixys natalensis</em> in South Africa extends from central KwaZulu-Natal Province near Scottsville northwards through the Weenen Nature Reserve and the Tugela and Pongolo River Basins along the Lebombo Mountains into Mpumalanga and Limpopo Province where observations have been made in the Manyeleti Game Reserve and Hoedpruit (Boycott 2014, TTWG 2017). It occurs in Swaziland (now eSwatini<strong>)&#160;</strong>throughout the Lebombo range (Broadley 1993) and has been reported at Big Bend, Lonhlupheko, and Tshaneni in the eastern Lowveld. The range extends peripherally into southwestern Mozambique along the Lebombo Mountains (Boycott and Bourquin 2000).&#160;</p>","Although little evidence exists to support the utilization of this tortoise, compared to data based on other <em>Kinixys </em>species, <em>K. natalensis</em> is likely harvested for the pet trade and for food and ceremonial purposes (Mifsud and Stapleton 2014). Multiple reports of this species in the United State and Japan pet trade are due in part to misidentified <em>K. zombensis</em> or <em>K. spekii</em> during shipping. Based on the CITES trade database, between 1992 and 2008 over 130 had been exported, mostly from Mozambique, with most going to Japan.",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Kinixys natalensis</em> is included in CITES Appendix II (as Testudinidae spp.) and receives formal protection in Swaziland and South Africa. In the latter, it is protected by provincial nature conservation ordinances and biodiversity laws at a regional level, but the species is not protected at a national level by the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act, 2004 (Act No. 10 of 2004). The range of the species overlaps (peripherally) several protected areas, including Kruger National Park, Manyeleti Game Reserve, Mbuluzi Nature Reserve, Mlawula Nature Reserve, Ndzindza Nature Reserve, Itala Game Reserve, Pongola Nature Reserve, and Weenen Nature Reserve (Broadley 1989, Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife Biodiversity Database). No formal research has been done on this species. Of greatest importance is that the conservation status of populations and their habitat should be more specifically assessed, as well as the threats faced by populations in different regions. In addition, research projects that focus on the life history traits, reproductive biology and ecology of the species should be initiated. </p>",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

Significant introduced species include goats, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, ants (<em>Solenopsis</em>), blackberry, and guava. Goats have been eliminated from Isabela in recent years and some of the other invasives are subject to ongoing management programs, but the risk of (re)introductions of problem species remains. Ants are currently the greatest problem in tortoise nesting zones. Poaching remains a significant problem and, along with ant predation on nests, can be considered a limiting factor. Poaching also has a direct impact on conservation actions, as the repatriation of tortoises must be to inaccessible areas where poaching is improbable to ensure survival of the young. Additional information is needed on the impacts of ongoing human activities (farming, poaching) on <em>C. guntheri</em> population dynamics.

As such, assessments have been completed for each of the 10 subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). At the global level, both geographic distribution and population size are much larger than required to qualify for a threatened category. The available long-term series of nest counts (used as an index of population abundance) show an important decrease in the past (47%). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle is considered as Vulnerable under current IUCN Red List Criteria (criterion A2b). The previous listing, published in 1996, was Endangered under criterion A1bd (Marine Turtle Specialist Group 1996).<br/><br/>Results indicate that the Loggerhead Turtle, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation according to any Red List criteria. However, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Loggerhead Turtle population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by IUCN Red List Categories), but also in the criteria under which the individual subpopulations qualified for a threatened category (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). For these reasons, the subpopulation-level assessments for the Loggerhead Turtle should be given priority in evaluating the true global conservation status of this species. This conclusion follows the precedent for other long-lived, widely distributed species, including the Leatherback Turtle (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em><strong>Justification<br/></strong></em>The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy exceeds the thresholds for criterion B, and the population size exceeds the thresholds for criteria C and D. Regarding criterion A, trends were estimated on time series datasets with ≥10 years of data of nesting activities (nest counts) at 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations out of 10 (North West Atlantic, Mediterranean, South West Atlantic, North West Indian, South West Indian, North Pacific). These six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current annual nests globally (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). The analysis revealed different trends for different subpopulations, with an overall -47% population decrease relative to population size three generations ago, which qualifies for the Vulnerable category (under criterion A2). The species trend at a global scale is basically determined by the two most abundant subpopulations, the North West Atlantic and the North West Indian, which altogether comprise about 75% of the current annual nests. They showed positive and negative trends, respectively. The other four subpopulations for which trends could be calculated show positive trends. For the remaining four subpopulations (comprising about 10% of the current annual nests; North East Atlantic, North East Indian, South East Indian, South Pacific), current trends are unclear, however past negative trends are known or suspected at least for the South Pacific and the North East Atlantic subpopulations respectively.<br/>&#160;<br/>The overall scenario suggests that, on the basis of the current knowledge, the extinction of the species at the global level is highly unlikely to occur in the short and medium term. However, the global status of the species in terms of distribution, number of subpopulations, genetic variability, regional ecological roles, and vulnerability, could change dramatically from the past and current situations. For this reason, the global assessment cannot be considered as an indicator of the true conservation status of the species, and priority should be given to the subpopulation assessments.<br/><br/><em><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong></em><br/><u>Criterion A</u><br/>For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (National Research Council 2010).<br/><br/>To apply criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of the Loggerhead, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 45 years (see the Habitats and Ecology section below). For criterion A, data from three generations ago (~135 years) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e., assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 years or more—are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for a review). Abundance data from ~135 years ago are not available for Loggerheads anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations ago (~135 years, one generation estimated 45 years; see Habitats and Ecology section below) was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation. A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another sea turtle species, the Leatherback Turtle (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013) and of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply criterion A we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations. For the Loggerhead global and subpopulation assessments we only considered time series datasets of ≥10 years.<br/><br/>For the global Loggerhead population, we considered time series datasets of 10-50 years, from 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations (see the individual subpopulation assessments). The index nesting sites included in the analysis are assumed to be representative of their subpopulations, and these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current total annual nests (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>The assessment under criterion A was conducted in three steps, as follows. Please see the separate subpopulation assessments for further details.<br/><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> We estimated past trends for each of the six individual subpopulations. Specifically, from one past and one recent abundance values (each representing the annual average of five year nest counts) we calculated overall trends (past-present) for each index nesting sites within subpopulations, and then we calculated overall subpopulation past trends for each subpopulation (criteria A1-A2).</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The past and present total abundance values of the six subpopulations (obtained from Step 2) were summed and from these totals the overall population change (past-present) was calculated (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). </li></ul>Five of the above six subpopulations showed positive trends and one showed a negative trend. Altogether, they showed a negative trend (-47%). The overall negative trend depended on the negative trend of one subpopulation (North West Indian) where criterion A2 was appropriate – i.e. the causes of reduction may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. Therefore, the overall trend of the six subpopulations was assessed against criterion A2. The past estimated trend was above the threshold for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 (30% decline) but below the threshold for the Endangered category (50% decline). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle qualifies for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 and the applicable subcriterion is (b), an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (counts of nests or tracks).<br/><br/>Although these trends consider only 6 of 10 subpopulations, these subpopulations with sufficient available data account for about 90% of the current global population abundance (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, these trends likely reflect the complete global trend and represent the best information available about the global population trend. Similarly, the global Leatherback Turtle assessment used only five of seven subpopulations to estimate global trends due to lack of sufficient data for two subpopulations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><u>Criterion B</u><br/>Since the population area extends over entire oceans around the world, the extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the threatened category threshold (20,000 km²). The area of occupancy (AOO) for sea turtles is identified with the nesting beach habitat, which represents the smallest habitat for a critic life stage. Since the appropriate scale for AOO is a grid 2x2 km, the threshold of 2,000 km² corresponds to 1,000 km of linear coastal tract, which is easily exceeded (by orders of magnitude) by the total length of nesting beaches globally. In conclusion, the global population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion B.<br/><br/><u>Criterion C</u><br/>To apply criterion C, the number of adults is needed and can be derived from the number of nests per year with the following formula:&#160; Adults = Nests * Nests per female<sup>-1</sup> * Remigration interval * Female proportion<sup>-1</sup>. With a current estimate of annual number of nests of about 200,000, for any reasonable value of the other parameters the population would easily exceed the threshold of 10,000 adults required to qualify for a threatened category under criterion C.<br/><br/><u>Criterion D</u><br/>The number of mature individuals (see criterion C) and AOO value (see criterion B) exceeded the respective thresholds. In conclusion, the population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion D.<br/><br/><u>Criterion E</u><br/>Although population viability analyses (PVA) were attempted at subpopulation level (Conant <em>et al</em>. 2009, Van Houtan 2011), in most cases they were not suitable for criterion E under this assessment. No PVA has been attempted at species level and such an approach would also be questionable because the subpopulations are independent units by definition.<br/><br/><strong><em>Sources of Uncertainty</em></strong><br/>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (National Research Council 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (National Research Council 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Loggerheads, including age at maturity, generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, remigration intervals, etc.). These values can vary within and among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends. However, we have reduced this source of uncertainty by using in the analyses those data sets obtained though standardized monitoring.<br/><br/>For the trend analyses (criterion A) we used data from index rookeries from six populations out of 10. Possible negative past trends associated to high past abundances in the other four subpopulations not included in the analysis could have changed the final result of the assessment (past trends, criterion A2), if such information was available.<br/><br/>For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).","The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide. Like most sea turtles, Loggerhead Turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (Bolten and Witherington 2003). Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10–39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5–3 years for females (Schroeder <em>et al</em>. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wibbels <em>et al</em>. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).<br/><br/><strong><em>Generation length</em></strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).<br/><br/>Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).","Threats to Loggerheads vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Loggerheads, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:<br/><ol><li>Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</li><li>Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e., consumption, commercial products);</li><li>Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc;</li><li>Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e., through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (for example fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</li><li>Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</li><li>The relative impacts of individual threats to all Loggerhead subpopulations were assessed by by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Loggerheads globally, followed by coastal development and human consumption of eggs, meat, or other products. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Loggerheads—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts. </li></ol>More detailed information at regional level can found in the specific subpopulation assessments.","Loggerheads are a single species globally comprising 10 biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) – hereafter subpopulations - which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. Regional management units are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are 10 Loggerhead subpopulations: NorthWest Atlantic Ocean, North East Atlantic Ocean, South West Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North East Indian Ocean, North West Indian Ocean, South East Indian Ocean, South West Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010)  (shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).<br/><br/>Total population size is unknown. The most common proxy for population abundance in sea turtles is the annual number of nests. A total of about 200,000 clutches are laid annually by the 10 subpopulations altogether (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Considering a range of 3 to 5.5 clutches per female, the above value would correspond to approximately 36,000-67,000 nesting females annually.",Decreasing,"The Loggerhead Turtle is globally distributed throughout the subtropical and temperate regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).","Loggerhead Turtles and their eggs are taken for human use (i.e., consumption and commercial products).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Loggerhead Turtles are afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (Wold 2002). Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A partial list of the International Instruments that benefit Loggerhead Turtles includes the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA), the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection, the Memorandum of Agreement on the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.<br/><br/>As a result of these designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). Guidelines are available to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations in coastal and high seas fisheries (FAO 2009). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. In most areas, the lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived Loggerhead Turtles.<br/><br/>More detailed information at regional level can be found in the specific subpopulation assessments.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The two currently recognized disjunct subspecies on Roti (<em>C. m. mccordi</em> and <em>C. m. roteensis</em>) have decreased from moderately common but restricted in the 1990s (with a total extent of occurrence (EOO) at that time of <em>ca</em>&#160;220 sq. km), to commercially and ecologically extinct at present, and now considered Possibly Extinct in the Wild, CR(PEW) A2acde+B2ab(ii,iv), based on a combination of (a) direct observation, (c) loss of habitat and area of occupancy, (d) documented exploitation, and (e) invasive predatory freshwater fish species, and on a residual area of occupancy (AOO) of &lt;10 sq. km and severely fragmented populations with continuing decline in area of occupancy and number of populations. The subspecies <em>C. m. timorensis</em>&#160;from Timor-Leste (which may represent a separate distinct species)&#160;is assessed as Critically Endangered B1ab(ii,iv) based on an EOO of 90 sq. km and only a single subpopulation. The species was last assessed in 2000 (when it was known only from Roti i.e. the concept excluded subspecies <em>timorensis</em>) as&#160;Critically Endangered A1d, B1+2e (version 2.3).","The habitat of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;consists of small, shallow, eutrophic inland lakes, swamps, marshlands and adjacent agricultural rice paddies and fields (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is reported to be entirely nocturnal, except during wet season rains. Reproductive ecology in the wild is largely unknown; female maturity may occur at about 10-11 years, similar to its Australian congener&#160;<em>Chelodina longicollis</em> (Kennett <em>et al</em>. 2009), giving a generation time estimate of about 15-20 years.&#160;In captivity, female maturity occurs at six years (Kayat and Saragih 2016), while a lifespan of about 30 years has been recorded from a wild specimen kept by local people on Roti (As-singkily, pers. obs.). Average clutch sizes of 12.2 (Maran and Coutard 2003) and 9.9 (Symanksi 2004) eggs have been recorded, with hatchling sizes of 23-29 mm and 25 mm carapace length,&#160;respectively. The diet of <em>C. mccordi</em> is apparently generalized carnivory or piscivory, with little dependence on hard-shelled bivalves or snails (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Timor-Leste, <em>C. mccordi timorensis</em>&#160;aestivates under dry grass near Lake Iralalaro, exposing individuals to collection and the threat of wildfires (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Local consumption of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em> has historically been minimal. Habitat conversion of appropriate habitat into agricultural rice fields has gradually eliminated much of the species' original habitat; however, the species often utilized these altered habitats. This increased the species' chance of collection for the pet trade and exposed it to the effects of increasing use of agricultural chemicals and pesticides (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Additionally, degradation of wetlands through deforestation and climate change effects further reduce the amount of appropriate habitat for this species. Massive land conversion for agricultural activity has destroyed most of original wetlands on Roti; from 1996 to 2016 Roti has lost 70% of its freshwater area (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). A habitat rehabilitation program is needed to recover the remaining wetlands on Roti.&#160;<br/><br/>The international exotic animal trade has by far been the greatest threat impacting <em>C. mccordi</em>&#160;subpopulations. As a result of its description in 1994 as a restricted endemic species, intense pressure developed from international pet trade demand, resulting in a rapid increase in that trade (Samedi and Iskandar 2000;&#160;Stuart <em>et al.</em> 2006; Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). The populations were decimated within five years and the species is now considered commercially and ecologically extinct on Roti. Invasive species, including pigs, dogs, livestock and predatory freshwater fish (Snakehead and Tilapia) have also impacted populations through trampling of nests and predation on hatchlings, severely limiting recruitment even prior to the final overexploitation of adults for the live animal trade.&#160;In Timor-Leste, pollution through garbage dumping and changes to Lake Iralalaro&#160;water levels are also impacting the species (Eisemberg <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;The species is also threatened by dry season fires, as it aestivates under dry grass.","Specimens of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;were collected in large numbers from the populations on Roti from the early 1970s well into the 1990s; field surveys on Roti in 1993 revealed that the main mid-central island population was still reasonably robust but was under pressure due to collection for the international pet trade (Rhodin 1994; Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). Since the mid-1990s, all known populations of <em>C. mccordi</em>&#160;on Roti appear to have suffered disastrous population declines of &gt;90% and are now commercially and ecologically extinct (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008; Ibarrondo 2004; Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2006; As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). Despite many surveys over the last several years, the last known specimens of <em>C. m. mccordi</em> or <em>C. m. roteensis</em> on Roti Island were recorded in 2009 (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data; TCC 2018), and the species may now be locally extirpated. However, some animals have been repatriated to central Roti from captive breeding facilities (D. Gunalen, unpubl. data) and more intensive surveys and trapping efforts are needed before declaring the two Roti subspecies to be Extinct in the Wild; a few isolated individuals may still persist on the island. Interviews with local fishermen in Timor-Leste indicated that as of 2015,&#160;<em>C. m. timorensis</em>&#160;remained relatively common within its very limited range (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Decreasing,"<em>Chelodina mccordi mccordi </em>occurs on western Roti Island (= Pulau Rote) in the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia and had an original EOO of <em>ca</em>&#160;200 sq. km, but this has now been reduced to an estimated AOO of &lt;10 sq. km, and the taxon is considered Possibly Extinct in the Wild.&#160;<em>Chelodina mccordi roteensis </em>occurs as a disjunct subpopulation on the&#160;Tapuafu Peninsula&#160;of eastern Roti Island, with an original EOO of &lt;20 sq. km, but now reduced to an estimated AOO of &lt;20 ha in two wetlands, and Possibly Extinct in the Wild.&#160;<em>Chelodina mccordi timorensis</em>&#160;occurs at Lake Iralalaro and surrounding streams in Nino Konis Santana National Park in the Lautém District of Timor-Leste and has&#160;an EOO of <em>ca</em>&#160;90 sq. km&#160;and has only one known subpopulation.","<em>Chelodina mccordi</em> on Roti has been essentially completely extirpated by massive overexploitation for the international exotic animal trade, starting first in the 1970s when it was considered to simply be an isolated population of the widespread&#160;<em>Chelodina novaeguineae, </em>which at that time was believed to occur widely as a single species across&#160;southern Indonesian Papua and Papua New Guinea, as well as northern Australia. Specimens were collected and exported from Roti since it was easy and legal to collect and export them from there rather than from the other areas of distribution, where collecting and export were either illegal or difficult. Major acceleration and focused exploitation of the Roti populations started in the mid-1990s after the description of <em>C. mccordi</em> as a new restricted endemic species (Rhodin 1994), leading eventually to its commercial and ecological extinction on Roti (Samedi and Iskandar 2000; Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008; Ibarrondo 2004; Shepherd and Ibarrondo 2005; Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2006). The presence of <em>C. mccordi timorensis</em> in Timor-Leste was not discovered and described until 2007. Interviews in Timor-Leste in 2015 indicated that it&#160;did not appear to being internationally traded there at that time (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016), but it has previously appeared in the pet trade.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"<em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;has beeen listed in CITES Appendix II&#160;since January 2005, with a zero export quota for Indonesia for specimens from the wild since June 2013.

A new captive breeding facility is being set up in Indonesian Timor, close to Roti (As-singkily and Horne, unpubl. data). Indonesia has legally restricted the trade of <em>C. mccordi</em> since 1997, but enforcement has been virtually non-existent; all exports of wild animals since 2002 have been illegal. However, Indonesia provides legal export permits for specimens claimed to have originated from captive breeding facilities, and one such facility operates on Java. <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;is listed as a protected species in Indonesia according to a new decree of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (no.

A resilient terrapin that can adapt to harsh environmental conditions. Not currently under any significant threats, but gradual habitat loss and progressive climate change could begin to impact populations. It is currently assessed as Least Concern.","<p><a><em>Pelomedusa galeata</em></a>&#160;is a large species of helmeted terrapin, with adults regularly reaching a straight carapace length (SCL) of 260 mm, and exceptionally up to 325 mm (Petzold <em>et al</em>. 2014). It occurs in fresh or stagnant waterbodies, including seasonal pans, flooded quarries and farm dams, and avoids mountainous terrain and forests (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). Rainfall is seasonal over the range of the species, with predominantly winter rains in the west and summer rains over central and eastern South Africa. Although it has been proposed that individuals aestivate during the dry season in both winter and summer rainfall regions (Boycott and Bourquin 2008), Stuart and Meakin (1983) found in a winter rainfall area that the terrapins disappeared during the coldest months and apparently bury themselves under vegetation away from water bodies. The species is known to move large distances overland and can remain in an inactive state for months or even years in arid regions (Boycott and Bourquin 2000).&#160;<em>Pelomedusa galeata</em>&#160;is primarily carnivorous but also ingests waterweeds and their roots (Boycott and Bourquin 2008). Females and males in the winter-rainfall region reach sexual maturity at 120-160 mm and 110-140 mm SCL, respectively (Strydom 2001). Mating usually occurs during spring with nesting from late-spring to autumn (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Strydom 2001).&#160;Nest chambers of 18 cm depth and 9 cm width are excavated close to the water and clutches with up to 30, exceptionally up to 42, leathery eggs are laid. Eggs measure 25-40 mm by 18-30 mm and weigh 10-15 g. In the summer rainfall region of South Africa, the incubation period is approximately three months; in the winter rainfall region, it is five to six months. Hatchlings have shells of 25-35 mm length and weigh 4-10 g (Boycott and Bourquin 2008).</p>","<p>The main land use practices over the range of the species are livestock farming and agriculture, which holds the advantage that these terrapins often colonize artificial dams built for livestock and irrigation. Pollution of water bodies due to agricultural practices may,&#160;however, &#160;pose a threat. The terrapins occur in a variety of wetland habitats and appear able to move overland for substantial distances, thus fragmentation of habitat is probably negligible.</p>","<p>Not much specific information is available on populations of <em>Pelomedusa galeata</em>, but the species is relatively common wherever it is found&#160;(Boycott and Bourquin 2008). During a study over a two-year period in the semi-arid region of the Robertson Karoo, 42 terrapins (25 males and 17 females) were captured from three dams in a 2,500 ha nature reserve (Stuart and Meakin 1983).</p>",Unknown,"Most localities in South Africa and Swaziland previously ascribed to <em>Pelomedusa subrufa</em> are now known to be that of <em>P. galeata</em>.

The species has not&#160;been recorded in Lesotho and it appears to be absent from the Bushmanland Bioregion in the Northern Cape Province. Boycott and Bourquin (2008) postulated that the presence of farm dams allowed <em>Pelomedusa </em>to expand its range into the western semi-arid regions of South Africa.

The extensive conversion of native thornscrub to exotic highly invasive Buffelgrass (<em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em>) pasture poses the greatest threat to&#160;<em>G. evgoodei&#160;</em>living in Sonoran&#160;<a>Foothills&#160;</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">Thornscrub (FTS) habitat<em>.&#160;</em>The distribution of invasive Buffelgrass fully encompasses the entire range of <em>G. evgoodei</em> (Búrquez-Montijo <em>et al.</em> 2002), so it is highly likely that its remaining area of occupancy (AOO) habitat within its&#160;geographic range is substantially less than 24,000 sq. km. Based on map overlays of <em>G. evgoodei</em> habitat (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016) and extensive stands of Buffelgrass (Búrquez-Montijo <em>et al.</em> 2002), loss and degradation of&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>&#160;habitat may have been as much as 20–30% of the species' range <a>over the past&#160;<em>ca</em> 50 years (two tortoise generations). It is estimated that habitat loss and degradation may continue at a similar rate for at least the next 20-25 years (one tortoise generation), potentially reaching total habitat loss or degradation of about 30–45% over three tortoise generations, a total of 70-75 years. F</a>urthermore, as the climate warms, mortality currently observed in FTS (Rosen <em>et al</em>. 2014b) will likely increase, and thus the shaded refuge for&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>&#160;within intact Tropical Deciduous Forest (TDF) will become more critical (Rosen <em>et al.</em> 2014c), further increasing the threat of additional habitat conversion. As such, we assess the species as qualifying for Vulnerable (VU) status under the ongoing reduction criterion A4ce.</p>","<p><em>Gopherus evgoodei&#160;</em>occupies hills and low mountains with at least some large boulders or rock outcrops in Tropical Deciduous Forest (TDF) and Sonoran Foothills Thornscrub (FTS). Its&#160;distribution differs from&#160;<em>G. morafkai&#160;</em>by its absence from Sonoran Desertscrub (SDS), its occurrence in TDF, and its stronger association with&#160;<a>FTS</a>. Similar to&#160;<em>G. morafkai</em> in Arizona,&#160;<em>G. evgoodei&#160;</em>often associates with slopes where rock outcrops and boulders are common. In TDF, the species generally&#160;excavates burrows under existing boulders or enters and modifies existing rock cavities; in flatter areas where boulders are unavailable, it digs burrows in soil&#160;(Rosen <em>et al</em>. 2014a), although not as extensively as&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;in the Mojave Desert. During 2012–2013 surveys in Sonora, only nine of 44 tortoise burrows (20%) in TDF were in&#160;<a>soil; t</a>he relatively flatter shell of&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>&#160;suggests it may be more saxicolous than&#160;<em>G. morafkai</em>, as well (Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016). In northern Sinaloa, Vargas (1994) reported that the species<em>&#160;</em>used packrat middens, dry cacti and even burrows dug by other animals (e.g. nine-banded armadillo,&#160;<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>). Our observations of&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>, during a nine-year radiotelemetry study near Alamos, Sonora, suggested that it uses several burrows a year and exhibits strong site-tenacity, returning to familiar dens year after year (Karl, unpubl. data). Tortoise activity corresponds with monsoonal rains and vegetation growth (Bury et al. 2002), and&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>&#160;is active from at least June well into November; there is little activity during the dry season (Karl unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Average age at maturity based on growth ring counts by Germano (1994) was estimated at 13.8 years for female tortoises from&#160;Sinaloa (=&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>), and 15.7 years in Sonora (= <em>G. morafkai</em>). However, an older age at maturity based on skeletal growth (Curtain <em>et al</em>. 2009) of 20 to 25 years for Sonoran tortoises (= <em>G. morafkai</em>) may be more accurate. We estimate generation time for <em>G. evgoodei</em> to be 20-25 years based on these findings and its similarity with the closely related&#160;<em>G. agassizii</em>&#160;(USFWS 1994).</p><br/>        <br/><p></p>","<p><em>Gopherus evgoodei&#160;</em>has a smaller distribution than either of its sister taxa and occurs in some of the most threatened habitat of any of the desert tortoises (Martin and Yetman 2000). The conversion of native thornscrub to Buffelgrass (<em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em>)&#160;pasture poses the greatest threat to&#160;<em>G. evgoodei&#160;</em>living in both Sonoran Foothills Thornscrub (FTS) and Tropical Deciduous Forest (TDF) habitat (Rosen <em>et al.</em> 2014a). Subsidized by the government since the 1960s, complete conversion to Buffelgrass has occurred in over 1.6 million ha of Sonora (<em>ca</em> 10% of Sonora’s area), and over 66% of Sonora has been invaded by Buffelgrass (Búrquez-Montijo <em>et al</em>. 2002). This African&#160;and southwest Asian&#160;grass aggressively invades FTS and, to a lesser extent, TDF. Further, Buffelgrass increases the frequency and intensity of fires (Esque <em>et al</em>. 2002, Van Devender 2002), thereby expanding its impacts. As of 2002, the distribution of Buffelgrass fully encompassed the range of <em>G. evgoodei</em>, and based on map overlays of <em>G. evgoodei</em> habitat (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2016) and extensive stands of Buffelgrass (Búrquez-Montijo <em>et al.</em> 2002), loss and degradation of&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>&#160;habitat may have been as much as 20–30% of the species range over the previous <em>ca</em> 50 years. Thus, it is highly likely that usable and cohesive habitat (AOO) within the&#160;geographic range of <em>G. evgoodei </em>has been substantially reduced, especially in FTS.<br/><br/>Also of major concern, invasive Buffelgrass stands potentially affect the operative thermal environment of the tortoise (Rosen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014c).&#160;<a>The TDF and wetter portions of the FTS occupied by&#160;<em>G. evgoodei&#160;</em>are naturally shady and comparatively cool at ground level in summer; however, much of the FTS is more arid and occurs primarily at lower elevations than TDF, and is thus hotter.&#160;Consequently, the thermal challenges in open Buffelgrass patches may be especially acute in FTS. </a>Mortality observations during fieldwork during 2012–2013 were <a>higher in FTS and lower in TDF</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;(Rosen&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014b).<br/><br/>Climate change involving warming and, regionally, potential drying and increased drought severity may affect <em>G. evgoodei</em> (Rosen <em>et al</em>. 2014a). Modeling by Sinervo <em>et al</em>. (unpubl. data) indicate that all gopher tortoises (genus <em>Gopherus</em>, including specifically <em>G. evgoodei</em>) face large-scale range displacement in this century, within 2-3 generations, likely exceeding the capacity of their dispersal potential. <em>Gopherus evgoodei</em> is somewhat buffered by the cooler TDF environment. It has been found in greater numbers in the more northern, lower elevations, and thus less mesic regions within the western Mexican TDF (Rosen <em>et al.</em> 2014a), offering some potential for increased habitat area under warming and drying conditions, though also potentially complicating population responses during stresses caused by climate change. The elevational gradient up which <em>G. evgoodei</em> would have to move is quite steep, and habitat conditions are established in divergent communities by relatively long-lived trees, limiting this option. The southern distributional limit of <em>G. evgoodei</em> is poorly understood, potentially permitting climate adaptation by movement south, but high predator abundance, heavy human use of lowland Sinaloa, and high temperatures potentially complicate such a response.<br/><br/>The expansion of large-scale mining within the range of <em>G. evgoodei</em>, as well as road mortality, are also identified as threats (Rosen <em>et al</em>. 2014a).</p>  <br/><p></p>","<p>Populations of&#160;<em>Gopherus evgoodei</em>&#160;throughout the species' range have decreased as a result of habitat degradation through the conversion of the preferred native Sonoran Foothills Thornscrub (FTS) and Tropical Deciduous Forest (TDF) habitats to buffelgrass pasture and other uses. In TDF regions, however, previous human consumption of desert tortoises (Fritts and Jennings 1994) has apparently been reduced, and this has been associated with increased recruitment (Rosen <em>et al.</em> 2014a).</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Gopherus evgoodei&#160;</em>occupies roughly 24,000 sq. km of&#160;the northern, relatively arid part of the Tropical Deciduous Forest (TDF) of western Mexico and relatively desert-like, though less arid, Sonoran Foothills Thornscrub (FTS) in southern Sonora and&#160;northern Sinaloa (Loomis and Geest 1964, Germano <em>et al.</em> 1994, Edwards <em>et al</em>. 2016). It also occurs in extreme southwestern Chihuahua (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;The eastern limit of its known range is the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental at elevations of 800–1,000 m where the TDF transitions rather abruptly into oak woodlands (Bury <em>et al</em>. 2002).</p>","<p>There appears to be some limited localized collection of tortoises for consumption and the pet trade. In the past, people used them more for consumption and occasionally as pets, but many ranchers still keep tortoises as pets.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p>Natural successional forces can restore habitat quality for&#160;<em>Gopherus evgoodei&#160;</em>in Buffelgrass areas upon cessation of slashing and burning. Secondary growth of native, woody species can quickly replace Buffelgrass in TDF. There is some evidence for this in thornscrub as well, although the lack of a seed source for the larger woody species and cacti at distances from intact TDF may require active revegetation efforts. Many local people are aware that tortoises enjoy protection and are part of nature. Their occurrence benefits society by providing employment in ecotourism and natural resource conservation; interview evidence strongly indicates that people in the TDF region no longer regard&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>&#160;as a potential food source, and recognize a valid conservation ethic for the species. A positive trend involves the establishment and partial re-purposing of private ranches as hunting and conservation reserves throughout much of the tortoise’s distribution in Mexico.&#160;The federal government has established large protected areas, which include a portion of<em> G. evgoodei</em>’s range.

Although it has a moderately sizeable distribution in the Pantanal biome of Paraguay, Brazil, and southern Bolivia, as well as the Chaco of Paraguay, almost no population status or trend data are available, and the increasing habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural and ranching conversion in the Chaco are potentially impacting the species. Should further large-scale habitat changes occur in this region, the species would become increasingly threatened.  Further research is needed on its overall distribution, population status and trends, and threats and conservation measures needed. A different taxonomic concept of this species was assessed as Near Threatened in 1996; the revised concept was also assessed as Near Threatened or Least Concern at an IUCN Red List workshop in Paraguay in 2012.","<em>Acanthochelys macrocephala</em>&#160;inhabits marshes, wetland areas, slow streams, shallow bays and salt lagoons. Mauro <em>et al</em>. (2004) and Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (2005) noted that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">A. macrocephala</span> prefers brackish lagoons in the Nhecolândia region of the Pantanal, many of which dry up in the dry season (July-September). Artner (2007) observed animals only in ephemeral waterbodies, including roadside drainage ditches, farm irrigation reservoirs and ponds in pastureland, and noted an apparent preference for large shallow water bodies. Artner (2007) suggested that the diet is mainly snails and aquatic insects, and local people interviewed stated that animals estivate during the dry season from March-April to at least October-November, and in some years may estivate for 18 months if rainfall is below average. <br/><br/>Vinke and Vinke (2001) observed mating in the wild in February in salt lagoons in the Paraguayan Chaco, and all females examined by Artner (2007) in February in the Paraguayan Chaco were gravid. Cintra and Yamashita (1989) recorded nesting in the wild in April-May in the Brazilian Pantanal, with clutch sizes of four and eight, and egg diameters of approximately 28.6-31.8 mm in length and 26.3-30.8 mm in width and weighing about 12.2-19.3 g each. A single hatchling from these eggs measured 38 mm carapace length (CL) and weighed 10 g. Hatchlings in the wild are said to emerge around December (Artner 2007). <br/><br/>Maximum recorded adult size is 29.5 cm for females and 23.5 cm for males (Cintra and Yamashita 1989). Sex ratio in a natural population in the Chaco of southern Bolivia was 0.67 males to females, with maximum female CL 27.9 cm and maximum male CL 22.5 cm (Dosapey and Montano 2004). In captivity, animals begin to display sexual dimorphism at about 12 cm CL, lay clutches of 7-10 eggs that require diapause for successful incubation, and hatchlings measure about 34 mm CL and weigh about 8 g (Artner 2007). Neither age at sexual maturity nor generation time is known for <em>A. macrocephala</em>.","<p>Both the Pantanal and the Chaco are considered among the most important wilderness ecoregions in the world (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2002), and although both regions remain largely intact, as of about 15 years ago overall habitat loss was already estimated at 30% for the Chaco and 20% for the Pantanal (Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. 2002). Agricultural and ranching development, especially extensive cattle grazing, is responsible for most of the ongoing habitat loss in the Chaco. Habitat loss is less of a current concern in the Pantanal. Although cattle ranching in the Chaco is degrading wilderness habitat, <em>Acanthochelys macrocephala </em>seems to be adapting to the altered landscape by opportunistically utilizing artificial cattle ponds and road-side ditches (Vinke and Vinke 2001, 2008; Artner 2007). However, as global climate change causes increasing drought and aridity in the Chaco region, these and other ephemeral aquatic resources are becoming increasingly threatened, and the last few years have experienced more severe droughts than usual (T. Vinke and S. Vinke pers. obs.). As a result,&#160;<em>A. macrocephala </em>may become increasingly threatened.</p>","Populations of&#160;<em>Acanthochelys macrocephala</em>&#160;appear to be robust in Parque Nacional Kaa Iya del Gran Choco of southern Bolivia, where it apparently occurs fairly commonly in most lentic aquatic habitats in the park, many of which dry up seasonally.

(2015) provided an extensive review of the habitats and ecology of <em>Batagur affinis</em>. The species inhabits estuaries, mangrove creeks, lower river sections, and coastal lagoons, generally in areas influenced by the tide, but may also occur substantial distances upriver (e.g. Perak). Nests on sand banks, either in rivers or on sandy beaches, and females may make substantial migrations between nesting and feeding grounds (up to 80 km) (Moll 1980, 1985).&#160;Females mature at 45 cm CL and may reach 60 cm; males mature at around 40 cm CL and can reach up to 49 cm (Moll 1985). This may occur at an age of nine years in captivity, and require up to 25 years in rivers with modest productivity (Moll 1980). Females may produce up to three nests per nesting season. In Perak, Malaysia, clutch size averages 26 eggs (range 5-38) (Moll 1980).&#160;</p>","Moll <em>et al</em>. (2015) provided an extensive review of the many threats to <em>Batagur affinis.</em>&#160;The species is heavily exploited both for its flesh and its large eggs, and also threatened by habitat destruction, sand mining, and construction of hydropower dams (Moll 1990, Moll and Moll 2000, Sharma and Tisen 2000, Iskandar and Erdelen 2006, Platt <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Thailand (Moll 1990) both types of exploitation have been significant and the species has been largely extirpated from the wild in that country, except for a small relict population in the Langun River area (Kalyar <em>et al</em>. 2007). In Malaysia religious beliefs and customs have reduced the killing of adult turtles for food. Sharma and Tisen (2000) listed dam construction, egg harvest, removal of riparian vegetation, sand mining, and incidental drowning in fishing nets as among the most important threats to the turtle. However, with the recent vast demand for turtles for consumption in China, poaching likely has been taking a steadily more significant toll (Rhodin 2000, van Dijk 2000, Compton 2000, Turtle Conservation Coalition 2011, Horne <em>et al</em>. 2012). The exploitation of the eggs in Malaysia became highly organized from the 1970s into the 1990s and included licensing of nesting beaches and commercial selling at rural and urban markets (Siow and Moll 1981; Moll 1984; Moll and Moll 2000, 2004). As of 2009, three licenses for collecting terrapin eggs were still given out to local villagers on the Perak River. The extent of poaching in Malaysia, due to its illegal nature, is not known but is likely significant, especially along the west coast, which has a larger Chinese population. Law protects the species, but enforcement in tidal areas tends to be lax. Interviews with riverine dwellers near Telok Intan (Moll 1990) indicated that terrapin caught incidentally by fishermen are often sold. Some fishermen purposely set nets for the terrapin (blocking small tributaries following high tide) while others fish for the turtle with hooks baited with mangrove fruit (e.g., <em>Sonneratia</em> sp.). An informant told one of us (EM) that, during an unusually dry period when the Perak River was low, a truckload of terrapins had been taken from the Telok Intan area. Egg collectors at Bota also claimed that female terrapins are being captured as they migrate upriver to nest. Their captors keep them in captivity until they lay their eggs. In some cases these captors reputedly beat on the turtle’s shell and hang them by their necks in order to make them drop their eggs. Other turtles are slaughtered to obtain the eggs.<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">Habitat alteration and destruction have become increasingly significant factors leading to the decline of river terrapins in many areas of Asia. Sand mining and dams are among the worst threats. Commercial sand removal for construction purposes is destroying nesting beaches throughout tropical Asia (Moll 1984, 1990, 1997). Dams located downriver from nesting sites prevent migrations between feeding and nesting sites. Dams upriver from nesting sites do not allow sand to move down river to replenish that lost to erosion or sand mining at nesting beaches. The Kedah River in Malaysia exemplifies the above problems. Dams have been built both above and below the nesting areas and sand mining has destroyed all significant nesting beaches (Moll 1984, 1987, 1997; Moll and Moll 2000, 2004).<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">Other important indirect factors include deforestation and siltation of rivers. On Malaysia’s Perak River the combination of deforestation and tin mining has led to a major increase in the silt load that<span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#160;may be the cause of increased and unseasonal floods. Unseasonal floods are particularly damaging if they occur during the nesting season, when a high percentage of the annual reproductive effort may be destroyed. A 1967 flood not only destroyed the entire reproductive output on the Perak River, but also destroyed 200 eggs in the state Game Department’s hatchery (Balasingam and Khan bin Momin Khan 1969,<span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#160;Khan bin Momin Khan 1977). Additionally floods deposit silt on nesting beaches that promotes the growth of tropical grasses on the sand. As nesting river terrapins require open sand banks for nesting, these grasses effectively destroy former nesting sites (Moll 1997).<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">Habitat destruction is also a problem in the feeding areas of the estuary. Clearing banks of vegetation in downstream areas has lowered the river’s productivity and carrying capacity by directly eliminating food sources. In the Perak River, plantation clearance has destroyed riverside mangroves on which the turtles feed, and replaced them with rip rap (large rocks) to control erosion. Commercial prawn farms are transforming mangrove swamps into ponds. Tidal barrages have also been built which block entry into many of the small tributary streams where river terrapins feed during high tide (Lim and Das 1999; Moll 1984, 1997; Moll and Moll 2000, 2004). A highway currently being constructed in Terengganu may affect nesting in the Terengganu River due to light pollution. Lights from a water treatment plant in the Dungun River illuminate the major nesting banks in Pasir Kumpal and Tok Chu. The plant has recently agreed to shut down this lighting during the nesting season (Chan, unpubl. data).<br/><br/><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">A large shrimp farm occupying 1000 hectares along the Chalok River (a branch of the Setiu River in Terengganu) has recently begun operations (Chan, pers. comm.). Its construction was approved despite opposition of conservation organizations such as WWF and many individuals. Huge marine shrimp farms located on the banks of rivers discharge effluents that can potentially increase salinization while introducing microbial pathogens and residues of chemicals and drugs. The water chemistry of the river is altered and the potential nutrient loading can cause eutrophication. Any increase in salinity is likely to impact the vegetation on which terrapins feed. Due to these concerns, the Department of Environment Malaysia in 2013 required this new shrimp farm to construct a discharge channel directly into the ocean.</span></span></span>","<p>Subpopulations of <em>Batagur affinis</em> are severely depleted throughout its range and extirpated from many former areas of occurrence (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>In Cambodia, a small subpopulation was rediscovered in the Sre Ambel and Kaong River system in 2001 (Platt <em>et al</em>. 2003), and a juvenile was found in the Stung Proat River in neighbouring Botum Sakor District (Holloway and Sovannara 2004). Heng Sovannara (pers. comm.) reported that over a five-year period (2002–2007) 23 nests were found on the Sre Ambel and Kaong Rivers, an average of 4.6 (range, 3–7) nests per year. However, only a single nest containing 23 eggs was found along the Sre Ambel in 2009 (Sovannara and Gately 2009).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Nutaphand (1979) reported that remnant river terrapin populations persisted in only three provinces, Phattalung, Songkhla, and Ranong. In a 1989–90 survey, Nutaphand found evidence that <em>Batagur</em> still occurred in two provinces near the Malaysian border, Phattalung (Pattharung) and Satun (Satoon) (Nutaphand 1990a, Moll 1990). Thirakupt and van Dijk (1994) and van Dijk and Palasuwan (2000) declared <em>B. affinis</em> to be extinct in the wild in Thailand, although Kalyar <em>et al</em>. (2007) reported a few wild individuals persist in the Klong Langu River.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, <em>B. affinis</em> was once very common on the major rivers throughout Peninsular Malaysia (Boulenger 1912, Moll <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 2015). However, since the end of World War II the species has undergone a major decline and populations in the western river drainages are currently Critically Endangered. Exploitation of adult river terrapins in Malaysia has been less than in some countries of the region for several reasons. Islam, the predominant religion in Malaysia, teaches that the flesh of amphibious animals is “<em>haram</em>” (forbidden by religious law). Eggs, on the other hand, are considered a delicacy and thought to have aphrodisiacal properties. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, harvesting of “<em>tuntung</em>” eggs was the prerogative of royalty, and nesting beaches were protected from general exploitation. <br/><br/>The case of the Perak River population in Malaysia was likely typical of what occurred throughout the country during the War (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). Prior to 1940, the nesting terrapin population probably exceeded 10,000 turtles, and some 375,000 to 500,000 eggs were laid annually on Perak sandbanks (Loch 1951; Khan bin Momin Khan 1964; Moll 1978, 1980, 1985; Siow and Moll 1981; Moll and Moll 2004). However, during the Japanese occupation food was scarce and previously unexploited sources of protein (such as the river terrapin) were heavily utilized. By the end of the war, <em>B. affinis</em> populations had been decimated. A survey conducted in 1976 estimated the numbers of nesting females to be between 400 and 1200 and egg production on the Perak River at less than 20,000 per year (Moll 1980). In 1989–90 the river terrapin population on the Perak River laid 25,098 eggs in 923 nests. Depending on whether these turtles average one, two, or three clutches per year, this would place the number of nesting females at between 307 and 923 (Moll 1990). In 1990–91 20,608 eggs were laid in 849 nests, indicating between 283 and 849 females in the nesting population. In 1999, only 677 nests were reported. Hendrie (2004) visited nesting sites on three Malaysian Rivers in February of 2004. On the Perak River, he reported that only eight nests were found in 2003 and that 20 had been reported as of 2 February in 2004 (near the end of the nesting season). More recent data provided by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) to E.H. Chan indicate no more than 40 wild nests were found from Perak River sand banks between 2005 and 2009. After 2009 no records of wild nests were available. Captive females at the Bota Kanan facility made 35 to 55 nests per annum between 2010–2013.<br/><br/>Also in Malaysia, on the Terengganu River, an island known as Pasir Lubok Kawah was for many years the most productive nesting beach for river terrapins. According to the staff at the Bukit Paloh Hatchery in Kuala Berang, an average of 60 females nested there annually from 1976 until 1987. Completion of a large dam upriver from the site in the early 1980s led to progressive erosion of the island until nesting suddenly plummeted with only seven females nesting there in 1988 and 1989 (Moll 1990, 1997). Due to the damage to nesting beaches along the Terengganu River, the hatchery and head-starting programme of the Terengganu Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) shifted some of its egg collecting to the Dungun River. However, recent data from the DWNP suggests a reversal of nesting decline on the Terengganu River. In 2008, 99 nests from 95 females were recorded, representing the highest nest numbers since river monitoring began in 1977 (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2008). These numbers have been maintained from 2009 to 2013, with numbers of nests ranging from 80 to 97 annually. In the Dungun River 30 to 49 nests have been recorded annually from 2009 to 2013 (DWNP data to E.H. Chan). The Setiu River in Terengganu has been monitored for nesting activity since 2004; Chan and Chen (2011) reported that from 2004–2009 the number of nests per year ranged from 17–30. This has dropped to no more than 10 in recent years. A newly discovered population in the Kemaman River has yielded 36–121 nests per year between 2012–2014 (P.N. Chen, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Subpopulations no doubt historically occurred in the mangrove swamps surrounding Singapore, but are now evidently extinct (Lim and Das 1999, Ng and Lim 2010). Introduced subpopulations of unknown size are apparently present in several inland reservoirs; whether or not these animals are reproducing has yet to be determined (Ng and Lim 2010; B.D. Horne pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Relatively few localities are known for <em>B. affinis</em> in Indonesia, all of them from the eastern portions of Sumatra (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mistar <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted surveys of North Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, and Lampung provinces along the eastern coast of Sumatra and concluded that although historically present, <em>B. affinis</em> is now most likely extirpated from this region. Habitat along the rivers of eastern Sumatra has been heavily impacted by human settlements and sand mining. However, terrapin eggs (presumably <em>B. affinis</em>) were available for sale in local markets in 2010, and according to information received from local fishers a remnant population of <em>B. affinis</em> may still persist in the Indragiri River and mangrove swamps around Mumpa (Enok District, Indragiri Regency).</p>        <p></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Batagur affinis affinis</em> occurs along the western coast of Peninsular Malaysia and eastern Sumatra in Indonesia and southernmost Thailand (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). <em>Batagur affinis</em> <em>edwardmolli</em> is distributed along the eastern coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the Songkhla region of adjacent southernmost eastern peninsular Thailand bordering the South China Sea, and Cambodia, where a relict population survives in the Sre Ambel River system. Formerly it extended into the Mekong delta of Vietnam (where a few animals may still persist), with the species occurring upstream to Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia. Additionally, archaeological turtle fragments from the lower Bang Pakaong River of southeastern Thailand have been identified as <em>Batagur,</em> suggesting that <em>B. affinis</em> historically inhabited all major rivers draining into the South China Sea. The isolated and now extirpated population of river terrapins from the southern Myanmar-Thailand border on the northwestern shore of the Malay Peninsula described by Nutaphand (1979) as the subspecies <em>B. b. ranongensis</em> is most likely attributable to the Northern River Terrapin, <em>B. baska</em>.</p>","<p><span class=""s1""><em>Batagur affinis</em> has been heavily exploited both for its flesh and its large eggs for a very long time, and is now also threatened by habitat destruction, sand mining, and construction of hydropower dams (Moll 1990, Moll and Moll 2000, Sharma and Tisen 2000, Iskandar and Erdelen 2006, Platt <em>et al</em>. 2008, Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<p>The River Terrapin (as <em>Batagur baska</em>) has been listed as Critically Endangered throughout its range (A1bcd) since the 2000 IUCN Red List, based on a range-wide evaluation in December 1999 that included the populations now attributed to <em>B. affinis</em>.

In Cambodia they are considered predominantly a lowland species in gentle sloping terrain.

During periods of inactivity, tortoises retreat into dense vegetation, alongside fallen debris, in buttresses of trees, in caves or burrows. The species appears to have large home ranges (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2014), signifying a need for large areas of suitable habitat to be protected. Historically the species has benefited from disturbance of evergreen forest in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam, as it prefers primarily deciduous forest types (R.

The volumes of trade may have appeared to reduced, but investigations into captive farms and legal trade reveal that trade levels&#160;for these sources may be higher than reported.<br/><br/>This intensive commercial exploitation came on top of the impacts from long-term (decades to centuries) low-intensity collection for subsistence consumption throughout its range (review in Das 1991, Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). In India, <em>I. elongata</em> is associated with Sal forest (<em>Shorea</em> spp); Sal flowers are collected for pharmaceutical purposes, leading to extensive opportunistic collection of tortoises. However, deliberate hunting also occurs, often with the aid of dogs (Pawar and Choudhury 20000; Platt <em>et al.</em> 2007, 2012). The species is collected both for local use and international wildlife trade. In the 1990s <em>I. elongata</em> was considered to be the most common chelonian species in the Vietnamese wildlife trade (Hendrie 1998), and large numbers have been reported in trade in Cambodia (Ihlow and Dawson 2016). Worldwide, a total of at least 918 live specimens, in 20 shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73). The Elongated Tortoise is also available in the international pet trade. However, the impact of trade as pets in minimal compared to the volume of trade for food (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Animals in Nepal, northeast India and Uttar Pradesh, are extensively traded for release at religious institutions; presumably as a result of targeted collection for this purpose.<br/><br/>Habitat impacts have been extensive as deciduous forests have been logged and cleared for settlement with seasonal, dry-land (slash and burn) agriculture; available habitat for the species has shrunk by more than half in the past 50 years in Thailand, and this percentage is probably comparable in other range countries, and even higher rates of habitat loss in Cambodia. Remaining habitat including in managed protected areas is widely impacted by human-associated wildfires, which create very high mortality among juvenile tortoises, to the extent that a population may be reproducing but is barely recruiting (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). This species appears to be absent from areas of dense human population and intensive cultivation (Ihlow<em> et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Other threats to&#160;<em>I. elongata</em> are minor and localised in comparison, with reports of decorative masks produced from the carapace available for sale in Nepal, although the species is not particularly favoured for this purpose (Mitchell and Rhodin 1996).&#160;</p>","<p>Despite having a wide distribution, and considerable suitable habitat remaining, severe population declines has occurred recently due to human activities (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2016). Scattered available information indicates that the species is depleted and now uncommon to rare throughout its range; survey findings consistently conclude that the species is rare and declining in India and Bangladesh (Moll 1989, Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). A 50-70% decline in population is believed to have occurred in the India/Bangladesh part of the range in the past 20 years (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018). There have been a few reports of <em>Indotestdo elongata</em> individuals in Bhutan's Royal Manus National Park but abundance is low there (Wangyal&#160;<em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>The best subpopulations in Thailand were estimated to have a density of one or a few animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). The sex ratio in this population was also heavily female biased at 1:2.45 (van Dijk 1998). The species is somewhat abundant within protected areas in Thailand, but is collected for consumption outside of protected areas. Habitat destruction has led to a severe reduction in population in northeastast Thailand (M. Cota pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In the latter part of the 20th century <em>I. elongata</em> in Lao PDR and Viet Nam were already scarce and localised (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018). Throughout most of Cambodia and parts of southern Viet Nam, the species was relatively widespread and common. Subpopulations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam and Cambodia have since been severely depleted and possibly locally extirpated.<em> Indotestudo elongata</em> is not uncommon in Myanmar, and subpopulations appear to be relatively stable (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). In Bangladesh, <em>I. elongata</em> is relatively common in good habitat, but not in areas of habitat degradation (S.C. Rahman pers. comm. 2018). The species' survival is not compatible with human land use (other than responsible tourism in national parks) and will eventually become exclusively restricted to protected areas throughout its range. Overall, a population reduction of 80% is suspected to have occurred over the species range in the past three generations (90 years) as a result of habitat loss and harvest for food.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia. The western most limit of the species range is in in Kaleshar Wildlife Sanctuary in the foothills of Himalayas in the Arravali Range. It has localised occurrences in northern and eastern India, Nepal and Bangladesh, Bhutan and much of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, and scattered occurrences in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, and extreme northwestern Peninsular Malaysia (Iverson 1992). Records from PR China (Guangxi) are derived from market animals. In Nepal,&#160;<em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is restricted to the terai vegetation zone; much of the terai has been converted to agriculture, and the species is now restricted to terai habitat in Chitwan National Park. A disjunct subpopulation occurs on the Chota Nagpur Plateau in eastern India, which appears to have been isolated from the Himalayan foothills by the alluvial plain and changing environmental conditions after the formation of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (Ilhow<em> et al.</em> 2016). Connectivity across the Brahmaputra is uncertain, as there is potentially a connection from the Himalayan foothills through the Sal forest belt to Orissa.</p>","<em>Indotestudo elongata</em> has long been used by humans as a source of food. Currently, <em>I. elongata</em> is heavily exploited for food and traditional medicine throughout its range (Ihlow&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Both opportunistic collection and deliberate hunting with dogs continue for local use and export to the international wildlife trade (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016). During the 1990s <em>I. elongata </em>were common in the Vietnamese wildlife trade and in Cambodia. It has often been reported as one of the most abundant species available in China (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).This species is also available in the international pet trade, however, the impact is small compared to the volume of trade for food and medicine. Currently the demand for pets in the United States and Europe is mostly met by captive breeding, however, some wild-caught animals still occur (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).",Terrestrial,"<p><em>Indotestudo elongata</em> is included in CITES Appendix II, allowing international commercial trade in the species provided such trade is not detrimental to the species, and subject to national trade legislation. It is also included in Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended), which lists species that require a small game hunting license to allow collection and local trade; the species may warrant transfer to Schedule I, which would afford stricter protection. In Thailand, the species is protected from exploitation under the WARPA law. Protected under government Decree 32 Group 2B (2006) in Viet Nam. Wildlife conservation act 2010 in Peninsular Malaysia. Wildlife Act 2012 in Bangladesh. It is not effectively protected in Indochina.<br/><br/><em>Indotestudo&#160; elongata</em>&#160; has&#160; been&#160; recorded&#160; from&#160; many&#160;protected&#160; areas&#160; across&#160; its&#160; range,&#160; including: Lawachara&#160;National Park in Bangladesh; Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary, Central Cardamom Protected Forest,&#160;Prey&#160; Lang&#160; forest,&#160; Phnom&#160;Nam Lyr Wildlife Sanctuary,&#160;and Virachey National Park in Cambodia;&#160;Jim Corbett National Park, Rajaji&#160;National Park, and Simlipal National Park&#160;in India; Nakai Plateau Protected Area in&#160;Laos; Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary; Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve, and Natma Taung National Park&#160;in Myanmar;&#160; Sakaerat&#160; Biosphere&#160; Reserve and Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in&#160;Thailand; and Cat Tien&#160;National Park in Viet Nam. This species is also suspected to exist in the protected foothill forest in the Transboundary Manas Conservation Area (Ahmed and Das 2010). Although it occurs in many protected areas, there is not always effective protection on the ground.<br/><br/>This species is the focus of conservation projects at the Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity (ACCB) at Kbal Spean, Cambodia and the Turtle Conservation Centre (TCC) in Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam. Work at both ACCB and TCC includes the rehabilitation and captive breeding of tortoises confiscated from illegal trade (Ihlow <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Safeguarding the integrity of large areas of protected areas including corridors (poaching prevention, management of forest fire, boundary protection) throughout the range of the species is probably the single most important factor to ensure the species’ survival. Commercial trade in the species must be restricted to captive-bred animals, and trade must be monitored carefully. Further status surveys are needed.</p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
152052098,12774,Manouria emys,Critically Endangered,A2cd+4cd,2019,2018-07-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Manouria emys</em> is in severe decline. Based on habitat loss rates alone, half the area of suitable lowland and mid-elevation evergreen forest has been degraded and lost in the past half century throughout its range. In addition, the species has suffered long-term subsistence collection and intensive commercial exploitation for East Asian consumption trade in recent years. Overall, the species has declined by at least 80% in the past three generations (135 years). This decline is expected to continue as turtle exploitation through most of its range remains beyond effective control, subsistence collection and poaching occurs widely even in some protected areas, and forest loss continues across much of its remaining range. This species qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered under criteria A2cd+4cd.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>","<p><em>Manouria emys</em> exclusively inhabits evergreen forest, from lowland regions up to altitudes of about 1,000 m (typically 600-1,500 m). The animals appreciate moisture and are typically found near water and frequently burrow in damp soil (Nutphand 1979). Lambert and Howes (1994) radio-tagged a female at Danum Valley in Sabah. This animal ranged in an area of 0.6 km<sup>2</sup> during 53 days of almost daily observation, her locations generally clustering for several days followed by a long walk of up to about 300 m, followed by another period spent in a limited area. Wanchai (2008) found the species to utilise a range of habitats, including bamboo forest, dry evergreen forest mixed with bamboo, dry evergreen forest, stream courses and swampy stream edges. Juveniles are rarely observed more than 20 m from streams; adults are also generally close to streams except during the raining season when they are seen to forage at greater elevations (Wanchai 2008). During the dry season, most individuals become inactive for a period of up to two months, buried in litter or under tree falls.<br/><br/>The diet has been reported to include bamboo shoots, tubers and other juicy vegetation (Nutaphand 1979) and some invertebrates and frogs (Humphrey and Bain 1990). Lambert and Howes (1994) observed their radio-tagged female feeding on 19 occasions, eating predominantly green leaves of understory plants and mushrooms, as well as some seedlings, sometimes including the roots, and fallen figs (<em>Ficus punctata</em>) on one occasion.<br/><br/>Animals of the nominate subspecies can reach up to 50 cm carapace length and 20 kg, while subspecies <em>M. e. phayrei </em>reaches 60 cm carapace length and 37 kg (Nutphand 1979). Size and age at maturity have apparently not been reported.<br/><br/>The social behaviour of this species is quite complex, with elaborate dominance and courtship rituals (described in captivity and illustrated in detail by McKeown <em>et al.</em> 1990). Lambert and Howes (1994) noted (attempted) matings of their radio-tagged female at Danum Valley during 6-9 March and on 16 April by a different male; another mating was observed on 14 May. In captivity, a nest is constructed by the female by sweeping leaf litter backwards to form a nest mound. In this mound, a clutch of on average 35 (range 15-51, N=24) spherical or slightly elongate eggs (41-54 mm diameter, weight 46-80 g) is laid, with larger females typically produces more eggs. The nest is defended against potential predators by the female during the first few days.<br/><br/>In captivity,<em> M. e. phayrei</em> reaches sexuality maturity at about 15 years (Fahz 2010). Longevity of this subspecies has been recorded up to 20 years, but it is likely to be much longer (Slavens and Slavens 2000). Generation length is estimated at about 45 years (three times age of maturity).</p>","<p><em>Manouria emys</em> is generally killed and butchered on the spot for its meat whenever encountered by local hunter-gatherers through much of its range, as well as collected for export trade for consumption in East Asia. Some wild-caught animals occur in global pet trade. The Turtle Survival Alliance confiscated 65<em> M. e. phayrei</em> in Myanmar recently (Stanford <em>et al</em>. 2015). A total of at least 507 live specimens, in seven shipments, were reported as seized from illegal trade during the period 2000-2015 (CITES CoP17 Doc73).<br/><br/>This species is also threatened by shrinking habitat availability as lowland and mid-elevation evergreen forests are degraded and lost through logging, clearing for agriculture, forest fires, and hydroelectric dams and reservoirs and associated infrastructure, although its preference for rugged wet montane forests may offer some protection (Moll 1989, Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Northeastern India, most of the habitat exists in Reserved Forests outside protected areas, where slash and burn agriculture is in decline, being replaced by horticulture. Organised large bamboo-cutting efforts in forests impact the tortoises both by removing a prime food resource as well as the increased disturbance and detection probability. Ethnic violence is a regional issue, and resettlement sites tend to be located in forest areas. In Mizoram, at least ten individuals collected from a proposed dam site were held captive in Aizawal Zoo for <em>ex situ</em> conservation (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018).</p>","<p>Nearly all accounts of <em>Manouria emys</em> note it to be uncommon, rare or very rare, and declining: interviews indicated that forest labourers and hunter-gatherers in northeastern India and eastern Bangladesh would find between one and six animals per year, even when using dogs to find the tortoises; some of this information pertained to the 1980s (Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). In 2018, the Singapore Workshop Participants considered <em>M. emys</em> overall Endangered in India, with a declining population trend. Recent records from India are only from Manipur, Mizoram, and Assam. Only three records of wild individuals have been reported in Assam since 2010, which have all been relocated to the zoo; and ten records from Manipur (S. Singh pers. comm 2018). It is considered Critically Endangered in&#160; Bangladesh and Myanmar (Participants, Singapore&#160;Red List Workshop 2011) and is apparently extirpated in the western side of Myanmar (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). It was considered ‘rare’ in Indonesia by Samedi and Iskandar (2000) and very rare in Sumatra. It has been recorded in trade in Malaysia since 1989 and it was considered to occur most commonly in sparsely-populated hill and mountain areas.<br/><br/>Low collection rates of a few animals per year were reported by hill tribe hunter-gatherers in western Thailand in the early 1990s (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995). Taylor (1970) noted that ‘These large turtles are now becoming rare in Thailand'. In 2005, the species was assessed as Endangered in the ONEP Red Data. More recently, Wanchai's (2008) study in the well protected Kaeng Krachan National Park in Thailand found 15 individuals in a 1.5 km<sup>2</sup>, suggesting that relatively high densities may occur in appropriate habitat without human pressures. In central Borneo, the species is not rare in good forest habitats (I. Das pers. comm. 2018). In northeast India, the local communities are reporting fewer captured individuals for this species, although no data on population size or trends are available (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018). A few juvenile and adult individuals have been collected in the border of Bangladesh and Myanmar.<br/><br/>No population data appear to be available for the other portions of the species' range.<br/><br/>Participants of the Singapore Red List Workshop (2018) suspected over 80% reduction in population has occurred over the past three generations (135 years) and will continue for at least another generation due to exploitation pressures and reduction in area of occupancy as a result of habitat degradation.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Manouria emys </em>occurs from Bangladesh and northeastern India through mid-elevation hilly areas of Myanmar, and western and southern Thailand through Malaysia and Indonesia (including Sumatra and Borneo) (Iverson 1992, Platt <em>et al.</em> 2018). Its presence in Brunei is uncertain. Records from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and southern China likely refer to <em>M. impressa</em> and/or traded animals.<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>M. e. emys</em> inhabits Thailand south of the Phang-nga-Surat Gap, Malaysia, Borneo and Sumatra. The subspecies&#160;<em>M. e. phayrei</em> occurs from Peninsular Thailand northwards through Myanmar to the northeastern Indian and eastern Bangladeshi hill tracts.</p>","<em>Manouria emys</em>&#160;is generally killed and butchered on the spot for its meat whenever encountered by local hunter-gatherers through much of its range, as well as collected for export trade for consumption in East Asia.

It is also included in Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (amended); it warrants revision to Schedule I. The species is protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act (2010) in Malaysia and trade is regulated. <em>Manouria emys</em> is protected under domestic legislation in Myanmar and under the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act (1992) in Thailand. It is expected to be included under Government Decree No. 7 in Indonesia soon; in 2017 Indonesian quotas were set at 50 animals, under 20 cm, for the pet trade.<br/><br/>In India, the Nengpui Wildlife Sanctuary, North Cachar Hills and Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary are known to support wild populations in less disturbed habitats (Ahmed and Das 2010). In Bangladesh it occurs in the Sangu Wildlife Sanctuary (Rahman <em>et al</em>. 2015). In Myanmar, <em>M. emys</em> occurs in at least one protected area: Rakhine Yoma Elephant Sanctuary. In Thailand, the species occurs in several protected areas, including: Kaeng Krachan National Park, Mae Wong National Park, Khlong Lan National Park, Khao Pra Bang Kram Wildlife Sanctuary, Umphang Wildlife Sanctuary, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, protected areas in the Nakhon Sri Thammarat mountains, and Bang Lang National Park in southern Yala Province (van Dijk and Thirakhupt 1995, Wanchai 2008; P.P. van Dijk pers. comm.). In Peninsular Malaysia, it occurs in one protected area: Taman Negara National Park (Lim and Das 1999, Norsham <em>et al</em>. 2000). In Indonesia, the species occurs in three protected areas: Gunung Leuser National Park, Danau Sentarum National Park, and Kerinci Seblat National Park. In Sabah, Malaysia, the species occurs in at least two protected areas: Tabin Wildlife Reserve (Høybye-Mortensen 2004) and Danum Valley Conservation Area (Lambert and Howes 1994).<br/><br/>Assurance colonies of <em>M. emys</em> exist both in-range and <em>ex situ,&#160;</em>but maintaining large enough groups in captivity to maintain genetic diversity is beyond what is logistically feasible. Three such facilities currently exist in Myanmar alone, with others established or proposed throughout southern Asia. A large assurance colony of 24&#160;<em>M. e. phayrei</em>&#160;has been established at the Zeepin Forest Reserve in Shan State, Myanmar. An assurance colony composed of village-confiscated&#160;<em>M. e. phayrei</em>&#160;has been established at the Rakhine Yoma Elephant Sanctuary in Myanmar. A much large assurance colony has been established at the Mandalay Zoo in Myanmar, which will be stocked with confiscated animals (Turtle Survival Alliance, unpubl. data 2012). Captive breeding by animals currently maintained in captivity can easily meet hobbyist market for this species, and a complete trade ban on wild-collected animals should be considered.<br/><br/>Captive populations are kept in a variety of zoos and other facilities (India, Sarawak), and can form the nucleus of captive breeding programs for eventual re-introduction. Training on husbandry and captive management is needed, as well as development of a strategy to replenish wild populations with captive-produced specimens.<br/><br/>The survival of the species outside protected areas seems unlikely, and effective protection of existing and perhaps additional protected areas will be key to its survival in the wild. Additionally, raising public awareness and utilising eco-tourism techniques may help to reduce poaching in protected areas. Additional survey efforts are needed across the species range. As the species occurs mostly outside protected areas or within exploited protected areas, community-based conservation could improve the conservation scenario faster in the northeast India (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2010). Updated status, especially in protected areas, is urgently needed, and more ecological information is desirable, as is detailed range-wide genetic and taxonomic characterisation of populations, particularly regarding subspecies in northeast Indian states. Captive breeding programs are required in Indonesia to sustain the population.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
155057916,11533,Lepidochelys kempii,Critically Endangered,A2bd,2019,2019-01-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The global population of the Kemp's Ridley is represented   by a single population with no known subpopulations (Bowen 1991, Bowen and   Karl 2007). This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with   approximately 71.2% of nesting for the species occurring on a single, 30.4 km   stretch of nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at Rancho   Nuevo, Mexico. The Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under   the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd based on an observed population   size reduction of more than 80% (estimated reduction = 82.6–88.3%) over the past three generations (<span class=""MsoHyperlink"">Bevan <em>et al</em>.   2016), whose causes are known and reversible, (e.g. egg collection   for human consumption), but some of which have not yet ceased (e.g.   incidental capture in fisheries, pollution).<br/><br/><strong>Justification<br/></strong>The Kemp's Ridley population qualifies for Critically   Endangered under criterion A2bd due to a long-term reduction in population   size that exceeds 80% (82.6–88.3%) the causes of which are known but have   not ceased. This reduction in nesting is based on comprehensive nesting data   since 1978 and on estimates of historic population size based on the 1947   Herrera film (Hildebrand, 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Information). The availability   of long-term nest counts (as an index of population abundance), and their   comparison to historic population estimates by Hildebrand (1963),   documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic   and current nesting data&#160;<span class=""MsoHyperlink"">(<span class=""MsoHyperlink"">Bevan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016), indicate that the current population represents a greater   than 80% reduction in historic population size (i.e. 82.6–88.3%   reduction). &#160;By comparing abundance   trends from recent years with an independent quantification of the estimated   number of turtles in the 1947 arribada filmed by Andres Herrera (i.e.   estimate of 26,916 turtles in a single arribada, one of several that occur   annually) and a previous estimate of total nesting abundance in that arribada   (40,000 turtles; Hildebrand [1963]) facilitated updated estimates of total   nest abundance in 1947. Using this approach, Bevan <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated   between 121,517 and 180,587 nests during the 1947 nesting season. In   contrast, the maximum annual abundance of nests over the past several decades   was 25,654 in 2017, and has averaged 21,156 from 2016 to 2018 (see Figure 2&#160;in Supplementary Information).   Causes for this recent deviation from exponential recovery are unknown at   present, but possibly include factors such as fisheries bycatch, impact of   the 2010 'Deepwater Horizon' oil   spill (DWH NRDA Trustees 2016; Gallaway <em>et al</em>. 2016a, b; McDonald <em>et   al</em>. 2017; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2017; Mitchelmore <em>et al</em>. 2017), and current   carrying capacity of the GoM&#160; (Caillouet   <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The causes for the decline from 1947–1985, ranging from   an estimate of 99.4% to 99.6% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016) were   clearly understood (e.g. incidental capture by fisheries, egg harvesting, and   natural predation at the nesting beach), and were reversible. The population   exhibited an exponential increase from approximately mid 1990s to 2009 due   to reduction of egg harvest on key nesting beaches as well as implementation   of turtle excluder devices (TEDs) in trawl gear operating in the Gulf of   Mexico (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is   unknown whether or not the recent deviation from exponential recovery is temporary, and if the recovery of the   Kemp's Ridley will regain its exponential recovery rate that was present   prior to 2010.<br/><br/>In summary, the current population   represents &lt;20% (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) of the historic population, or a &gt;80%   decline in abundance, and though causes for this decline are understood, they   have not yet ceased. For these reasons, the Kemp's Ridley qualifies as Critically Endangered under the IUCN Red List Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion A: <em>Critically   Endangered<br/></em>Rationale: An observed population size reduction of ≥80%   (estimate ranging from to 88.3% (Hildebrand 1963, Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) to 82.6%   (Bevan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2016)) over three generations based on b) an index of abundance   appropriate for the Kemp's Ridley (i.e. total number of nests per season),   and d) actual or potential levels of exploitation. Primary factors   contributing to the decline included 1) harvesting of eggs on the nesting   beach (Hildebrand 1963; Adams, 1966), 2) incidental capture by fisheries   (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011. Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990), and 3) natural predation on the   nesting beach (Hildebrand 1963, Pritchard and Marquez 1973, Marquez 1994).&#160; The observed decline is based   on a comparison to historic population estimates in Hildebrand (1963),   documentation from Andres Herrera recorded in 1947, and analysis of historic   and current nesting data (Bevan <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite an exponential increase   in abundance from the 1990s through 2009, the recent deviation from this   exponential recovery rate since 2009 is currently not understood and may not   be reversible. These factors are also the basis for the conclusion that the   Kemp's Ridley is Critically Endangered   under Criterion A2bd.<br/><br/>Criterion B: <em>Least   Concern<br/></em>Although the Kemp's Ridley occurs throughout the   coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast of USA, all   Kemp’s belong to a single location (i.e. genetic stock). The Kemp's Ridley has shown a strong site fidelity   over time for the primary nesting beach near Rancho Nuevo (at least since   1947 Herrera film). Approximately 71.2% of global Kemp's nesting occurs on   30.4 linear km of beach near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico and approximately 97% of   the Kemp's Ridley global population’s nesting activity occurs on a 146 km   stretch of beach that includes Rancho Nuevo along the western Gulf of Mexico   in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Thus, the area of occupancy (AOO) is less   than 500 km<sup>2</sup>. Lower levels of nesting occur in scattered areas   along the coasts of Veracruz, Mexico, and Texas, US, but these beaches serve   as nesting habitat for less than 3% of the population. The occurrence of a   single primary nesting beach qualifies under B2a “Severely fragmented or   known to exist at only a single location” and it has an area of less than 500   km<sup>2</sup> (B2). Additionally, the Kemp's Ridley has had an unexpected   deviation from its exponent recovery rate, but it is unclear whether this is   actually a continuing decline in population size. Therefore, this   subpopulation is Least Concern under criterion B.<br/><br/>Criterion C and D: <em>Least   Concern<br/></em>Population of mature individuals (adult males and   females) is currently estimated as 15,664 therefore, the Kemp's Ridley does   not qualify for a threatened category under criteria C or D. The   current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (22,341) was   calculated using standard IUCN protocol for sea turtle red list assessment.&#160; The calculation takes into account the average   number of annual nests from 2016-2018 (n=21,156), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, a   remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males   (all values are reviewed in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's   Ridley; NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Criterion E: Not assessed<br/>Rationale: There have been no formal PVAs conducted</span></p>","The Kemp's Ridley inhabits coastal areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Hildebrand 1982, Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994) (Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (see Geographic Range for detailed range/distribution). Although the primary nesting beach is located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, coastal areas throughout the GoM are important developmental and foraging habitat, as well as migratory corridors for reproductively active adults (Dobie <em>et al</em>. 1961; Hildebrand 1963, 1982; Ogren and McVea 1982; Marquez 1984; Hildebrand 1987; Ogren 1989; Witzell and Schmid 2005; Pritchard 2007; Shaver and Rubio 2008; Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013; Shaver <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;2016a, 2016b; Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). Additionally, the regular occurrence of juvenile Kemp's Ridleys in coastal areas along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. indicate that these areas also represent developmental and foraging habitats (Lazell 1980, Morreale <em>et al</em>. 1992, Musick and Limpus 1997). In addition to the coastal neritic habitats, the offshore (‘oceanic’) waters of the GoM and Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are also habitats for hatchling, post hatchling, and juvenile Kemp's Ridleys (Witherington <em>et al.</em> 2012, Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013, McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017). These areas of the GoM and Atlantic represent important developmental and foraging habitat for both oceanic and neritic life history stages of the Kemp's Ridley. &#160;&#160;For further information on Kemp's Ridley habitat use and ecology, see reviews in NMFS <em>et al</em>.

This species primarily occurs in the Gulf of Mexico, with a single primary nesting beach located in the western Gulf of Mexico near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico.<br/><br/>Population assessment methods for sea turtles have been addressed recently (Committee on Sea Turtle Population Assessment Methods 2010, Bjorndal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2016). A variety of metrics can provide insight on the size and dynamics within a population.&#160; In the case of the Kemp's Ridley, the number of nests produced per year by this species represents an accurate metric for estimating the size of the adult population. Further, this metric has been has been consistently recorded for several decades in the Kemp's Ridley.<br/><br/>The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (n=22,341) was calculated using the standard IUCN&#160; protocol for sea turtle Red List assessments. The calculation takes into account the total average number of annual nests from 2016–2018 (n=21,156; see Table 1 in Supplementary Information), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, an average remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males. All values are reviewed and reported in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Kemp's Ridley has one of the most restricted distributions of all sea turtles (Wallace   <em>et al</em>. 2010; see range map and Figure 1 in Supplementary Information). This species is primarily distributed throughout the   Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973; Marquez 1984, 1994;   Pritchard 2007), with rare occurrences&#160; along the Atlantic coasts of Canada, Europe,   as well as Bermuda, the Azores, Madeira, and the Mediterranean Sea (Carr and   Caldwell 1956;&#160;Carr 1957, 1980; Mowbray and Caldwell 1958; Zwinenberg 1977; Brongersma <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 1979;   Brongersma 1982; Bolton and Martins 1990; Tomás <em>et al</em>. 2003; Marquez-M.&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004; Guzman-Hernandez   <em>et al</em>. 2007; Witt <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007; Tomás and Raga 2008;&#160;Ernst and Lovich 2009; Insacco and Spadola 2010; Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2015; Shaver <em>et al</em>. 2015). Nesting is primarily restricted to the western Gulf of   Mexico, ranging from Texas, United States, to Veracruz, Mexico, with the   majority of nesting occurring on an approximate 30 km stretch of the primary   nesting beach with an epicenter located near Playa de Rancho Nuevo, in the   state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. (see Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994, Pritchard 2007, NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011, Shaver <em>et al</em>. 2016b).</p>",The Kemp's Ridley is a protected species throughout its distribution in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coastal waters of the U.S. There is no legal trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Sections   G.1.1. through G.3.1 of the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley   Sea Turtle (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011) provide a comprehensive review of the   conservation actions that have been implemented to protect the Kemp's Ridley   and facilitate its recovery.&#160; Those   sections are shown below:<br/><br/><strong>G.1. Existing Regulatory Mechanisms</strong><br/><br/><em>G.1.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Efforts   to protect nesting Kemp's Ridleys and nesting beaches in Mexico have been   ongoing since the 1960s (Marquez 1994). Legal ordinances were enacted that   prohibited harvest of certain marine turtle species seasonally from May to   August in the Gulf of Mexico in 1973 (DOF 1973); and all marine turtle   species that occurred along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico were protected   year-round in 1978 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1989). In 1990, take of all marine turtle   species was prohibited by presidential decree (DOF 1990). Also in 1990, the Secretariat of Urban   Development and Ecology (SEDUE) and Secretariat of Fisheries (SEPESCA)   published the “Programa Nacional de Protection y Conservacion de Tortugas   Marinas (Propuesta).” This document was the origin of the National Program   for Protection, Conservation, Research and Management of Marine Turtles,   which was implemented in 2000 and which proposed strategies and actions for   the protection, conservation, and recovery of marine turtle populations that   nest in Mexico. Rancho Nuevo was declared a Natural Reservation in 1977 (DOF   1977) and further protection measures were added in 1986 (DOF 1986, Marquez <em>et   al</em>. 1989). Rancho Nuevo was declared a   Sanctuary in 2002 (DOF 2002). In 2004, it was included in the listing of   Wetlands of International Importance under the Convention on Wetlands   (RAMSAR).<br/><br/>In   1993, Mexico mandated the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) in the Gulf   of Mexico and the Caribbean through the publication of the Official Mexican   Norm NOM-002-PESC-1993 (DOF 1993). In   1997, the NOM was modified to require the use of hard TEDs along the Pacific,   Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean coasts (DOF 1997). Hard TEDs are similar to those used in the   U.S., consisting of a metal grid installed in front of the codend and an   escape opening either at the top or bottom of the net. These, and a number of factors are   responsible for the post-1990 increase in survival rates (e.g. nest   protection, TEDs, decreased shrimping effort), which have contributed to the   increase in reproduction documented on the nesting beaches (TEWG 1998,   Heppell <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/><em>G.1.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>The   Kemp's Ridley has been protected under U.S. law since its listing as an   endangered species on December 2, 1970. The US Endangered Species Act (ESA)   prohibits ‘take’ of species listed under its authority. Take is defined as   “harass, harm [to the species or its habitat], pursue, hunt, shoot, wound,   kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such   conduct.” Exceptions to the take prohibitions may be provided under the ESA   for research, experimental populations, and take incidental to otherwise   legal activities as long as the take does not jeopardize the continued   existence of the species or adversely modify the species’ critical habitat.   The ESA also calls for recovery plans, such as this one, to help guide the   recovery of the species. Protection from international trade has been   afforded by CITES under which the Kemp's Ridley is listed on Appendix I.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Beach Protection</strong><br/><br/><em>G.2.1.&#160; Mexico<br/></em>In   1966, Mexico sent a team of biologists that included Humberto Chavez, Martin   Contreras, and, in 1967, Rene Marquez, to Rancho Nuevo, Tamaulipas, to survey   the Kemp's Ridley sea turtle population at Rancho Nuevo, and to establish a   conservation effort for this diminishing population (Chavez <em>et al.</em> 1967). The   objective of the effort in Mexico was to protect the remaining nesting females,   their eggs and hatchlings from human and animal predators thus eliminating   the land-based mortality from the life cycle.<br/><br/>From   1966 to 1987, the conservation program focused on the area of Rancho Nuevo   with the camp located first at Barra Calabazas and then at Barra Coma where   it presently exists. In 1977, the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service (FWS),   Mexico’s National Park Service (NPS), the US National Marine Fisheries   Service (NMFS), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) all joined   in the conservation efforts with Mexico’s Instituo Nacional de Pesca (INP) at   Rancho Nuevo (Manzella <em>et al</em>. 1988, Woody 1989).&#160; In 1988, the program (now a bi-national   one), expanded to the south to Barra del Tordo with a camp at Playa Dos. In   1989, a third camp was established to the north at Barra Ostionales on Rancho   Los Pericos. The north camp's location was changed 10 km to the north of its   original location, to near the town of Tepehuajes in 1996 for logistical   reasons. Also in 1996, in coordination with SEMARNAP and the Tamaulipas'   State Government, a camp was established in La Pesca. Under SEMARNAP’s   supervision, Gladys Porter Zoo (GPZ), Administracion’ Portuaria Integral de   Altamira (API Altamira) and Universidad del Noreste expanded the project to   include the beaches of Tampico and Altamira. In Veracruz, El Raudal camp was   installed in 1994, but was later transferred to Lechuguillas, municipality of   Vega de Alatorre. In 1997, this camp   was incorporated into the bi-national program.<br/><br/>In   the 2002 season, two auxiliary corrals were constructed on the Rancho Nuevo   beach. One was located to the north at Barra Carrizo and the other was   constructed to the south. The additional corrals were constructed to protect   nests from predation, decrease the distance eggs were transported, and   provide additional space to the main corral at Rancho Nuevo.<br/><br/>Today,   general monitoring and protection activities consist of daily beach patrols   made by one team to search for nesting females and protect observed nests.   When several females are counted in one trip, the monitoring team alerts the   camps of a possible arribada event. During the arribadas, several teams   patrol the beach on all-terrain vehicles, collecting biological data from   females and relocating clutches to the protected corrals. The clutches are   collected and transported to the corrals as soon as possible, with the   necessary precautions to avoid the early embryo mortality caused by handling.   Each clutch is reburied in a cavity of similar size and depth as the <em>in situ</em>   nest and marked for monitoring throughout the incubation period.&#160; After hatchlings emerge from their nests,   they are counted, collected, and released in large groups in different spots   on the beach. The content of the nest is excavated after the hatchlings are   released to determine hatching success.<br/><br/><em>G.2.2.&#160; United States</em><br/>During   the last 50 years, more confirmed Kemp's Ridley nests have been located at Padre   Island National Sea Shore (PAIS) in south Texas than at any other location in   the U.S. (Shaver and Caillouet 1998, Shaver 2005a).&#160; The first documented record of Kemp's Ridley nesting on the Texas coast was made in 1948 (Carr 1967) at what was   later designated as PAIS. PAIS is considered a secondary nesting colony   (Shaver 1998a, Shaver 1999). Nests have been found elsewhere in the   southeastern U.S. in conjunction with reports from the public and during   monitoring conducted for loggerhead nesting activity (Anonymous 1992, Marquez   <em>et al</em>. 1996, Johnson <em>et al</em>. 1999, Foote and Mueller 2002, Williams<em> et al</em>.   2006).<br/><br/>Since   1986, NPS staff and volunteers have conducted patrols on North Padre Island   to detect and protect nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles and their eggs, determine   results of the imprinting and headstarting experiment (see G.4.2. Imprinting   and Headstarting), and gather biological data (Shaver 1990, 2005a).&#160; Patrols are conducted along the entire 128   km Gulf of Mexico shoreline of North Padre Island, including 104 km of PAIS   and 24 km north of the PAIS north boundary and patrol effort increased over   time (Shaver 2004, 2005a).&#160; From   1986–1994, the entire North Padre Island target patrol area was covered from   2–5 days each week. From 1995–1997, the entire area was covered seven days each   week. Starting in 1998, the entire area was repeatedly traversed each day to   increase the likelihood of observing nesting females and locating their eggs.<br/><br/>Systematic   patrol programs were developed by various entities to detect Kemp's nesting   at other locations in Texas starting in 1999.&#160;   NPS staff at PAIS aided with development of many of these other   nesting patrol projects by providing training, technical assistance, and some   equipment.<br/><br/>FWS,   Sea Turtle, Inc., and GPZ (some years) led a program of repeated daily   patrols by staff, volunteers, and interns on the 11 km of Boca Chica Beach   beginning in 1999 and on the northernmost 51 km of South Padre Island   beginning in 2000. Additional walking patrols were conducted on the southern   developed portion of South Padre Island starting in 2006. FWS staff and Texas   Master Naturalists volunteers began patrols on 45 km of Matagorda Island in   2003 and later expanded this program to include more days per week, repeated   daily patrols, and the entire Kemp's Ridley nesting season. Staff and   volunteers with the Animal Rehabilitation Keep (ARK) and University of Texas   Marine Science Institute at Port Aransas conducted a few nesting patrols on   30 km of Mustang Island during the 2004 nesting season. The program was   reinstituted and expanded to encompass at least one patrol per day during   most days of the nesting season in 2006 and all days of the nesting season   starting in 2007. San Jose Island has been patrolled once every eighth day   since the mid-1990s. In 2005, volunteers with Help Endangered Animals-Ridley   Turtles (HEART) and the Sea Turtle Restoration Project conducted patrols   intermittently during the nesting season along various segments of the 230 km   shoreline between Sabine Pass and the Matagorda Peninsula. This effort   continued, but starting in 2006 FWS led the intermittent patrols by staff and   volunteers on the northern end of Matagorda Peninsula. Texas A&amp;M   University at Galveston (TAMU) conducted patrols on Galveston Island starting   in 2007 and on Bolivar Peninsula starting in 2008.<br/><br/>Educational   programs alerting beach users to report nesting Kemp's Ridley turtles were   implemented at PAIS in the mid-1980s and later expanded coast-wide by various   groups (Shaver 1990, 2004, 2005a, 2006b, 2006c; Shaver and Miller 1999).   Beach user reports have been investigated, resulting in documentation of up   to half of the Kemp's Ridley nests found in Texas each year through the   mid-2000s. However, from 2006–2010, beach users only found 14–21% of the   annual number nests documented in Texas, likely due to the more comprehensive   patrol programs conducted state-wide during those years.<br/><br/>From   1978-1999, eggs from the nests found by patrollers and beach users along the   entire Texas coast were transported to the incubation facility at PAIS for   protected care. After 2000, eggs from most nests located on North Padre   Island and northward on the Texas coast were transferred to the   facility.&#160; The first two incubation   facilities at PAIS were screen-enclosed structures attached to   buildings.&#160; The first was operated from   1978–1982, the second was operated from 1983-2005, and both were used to hold   over 22,000 incubating eggs received from Mexico during the experimental   imprinting and headstarting project from 1978-1988 (see G.4.2. Imprinting and   Headstarting).&#160; A larger solid-walled   building was used starting in 2006. Further information on the incubation   facilities and egg care procedures can be found in Shaver (1989, 1990, 1994,   1997a, 1997b, 1998a, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005a, 2005b, 2006a,   2006b) and Shaver <em>et al</em>. (1988). Nearly all of the turtles hatched in the   incubation facility were released during the early evening, night, or morning   at the northern end of PAIS, in the vicinity of the incubation facility,   although a few were released elsewhere on the beach. Healthy hatchlings from   all but one of the nests found in Texas were allowed to go free after   release.<br/><br/>However,   hatchlings from one Texas nest were transferred to the NMFS Galveston   Laboratory for headstarting, as were the majority of hatchlings that emerged   from eggs that were part of the 1978–1988 experimental imprinting effort (see   G.4.2. Imprinting and Headstarting).<br/><br/>Starting   in 2008, some nests found at the southern end of PAIS were incubated in a   corral located at the turtle patrol base camp, near the PAIS 64-km marker.   The hatchlings from these nests were released at the southern end of PAIS (D.   Shaver, PAIS, pers. comm. 2009).<br/><br/>In   2000 and 2001, eggs found on Boca Chica Beach and South Padre Island were   transferred to a corral on Boca Chica Beach.&#160;   In 2002, eggs found on Boca Chica Beach were transferred to a corral   there and on South Padre Island were transferred to a corral there. Starting   in 2003, eggs from both South Padre Island and Boca Chica Beach nests were   incubated in a corral on South Padre Island.&#160;   The hatchlings were released at the corral locations that they emerged   from on Boca Chica Beach or South Padre Island.<br/><br/><br/><strong>G.3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Marine Protection<br/><br/></strong><em>G.3.1.&#160; Mexico</em><br/>Mexico   has implemented several protection measures for turtles in the marine   environment. Sailing and fishing within 6.44 km of the beach at Rancho Nuevo   was prohibited through the 1986 amendment to the declaration of Rancho Nuevo   as a National Reservation and the 2002 declaration as a Sanctuary. TEDs have   been required in the shrimp fishery operating in the Gulf of Mexico and   Caribbean since 1993.<br/><br/>Mexican   Official Standard NOM-029 (DOF 2006) prohibits the longline shark fishery   from fishing in a 5 km buffer zone off the six beaches of Tamaulipas from   March through June and the five beaches of Veracruz from March through   August, which overlap with the nesting period of the Kemp's Ridley.&#160; The NOM also mandated removal of fish hooks   from turtles captured incidentally and required longlines to be used in the   marine zone, away from a coastal band of 18.53 km starting from the baseline   from which the Territorial Sea is measured (DOF 2007).<br/><br/><em>G.3.2.   United States</em><br/>Development   of TEDs began in the late 1970s to reduce incidental capture of sea turtles   in the shrimp fishery (Henwood <em>et al</em>. 1992). TEDs consist of a device that   prevents the turtle from entering the codend of the net and an escape opening   that allows the turtle to escape. TEDs were first required by Florida state   law in 1987 to be used by large shrimp vessels operating along the east coast   of Florida between 28° and 29° N. latitudes.&#160;   From 1987 through 1990, their seasonal use in the shrimp fishery   expanded to include all ocean waters south of the North Carolina/Virginia   border all the way around to Texas. Beginning in 1992, TEDs were required in   the summer flounder fishery operating in waters off North Carolina to   southern Virginia; at the same time, the shrimp fishery rules were expanded   to require TED use in both inshore and ocean waters during all times of the   year. The National Research Council (Magnuson <em>et al</em>. 1990) reviewed numerous   studies and data and determined that there was strong evidence that shrimp   trawling was the primary cause of sea turtle mortality in the southeast   United States. They estimated that shrimp trawling caused 86% of the human   caused mortalities of juvenile and adult sea turtles. The consistent and   correct use of TEDs has reduced mortality due to shrimp fishing and   contributed to the Kemp's Ridley population increase. It is also likely that   the decline in the shrimp fishing effort in the northern Gulf of Mexico since   the early 1990s has reduced sea turtle mortalities from shrimp trawling   (Caillouet <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hart and Nance, 2013, NMFS 2007a).<br/><br/>Since   1990, corresponding with the more widespread use of TEDs in U.S. waters, the   instantaneous mortality rate of neritic sea turtles (all species observed to   interact with the shrimp fishery) has been reduced by 44%-50% (TEWG 2000).   The range in annual mortality reduction represents the post-1990 mortality   multiplier necessary to be included in the model to obtain the observed rate   of the Kemp's Ridley population increase. Age-based models indicate an   increase in large benthic and adult survival post-1990s (Heppell <em>et al</em>.   2005).<br/><br/>In   addition to the use of TEDs, time and area closures have been established to   enhance shrimp catch. The Texas Legislature established the Texas Closure   through the Shrimp Conservation Act of 1959. The Texas Closure was   implemented to delay harvest of brown shrimp in the Texas Territorial Sea   (TTS) until the shrimp reach a larger, more valuable size and to minimize   waste caused by discarding smaller shrimp during Gulf harvest (Fuls 2001).   The timing of the closure can be altered by Texas, but generally occurs   mid-May through mid-July, which coincides with the peak Kemp's Ridley nesting   period. In addition, the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council Shrimp   Fishery Management Plan implements a closure of the U.S. waters off Texas to   complement the traditional Texas Closure. Several rules were adopted in the   early 2000s by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission to reduce fishing   effort on shrimp stocks and provide additional protection to sea turtles,   particularly in the nearshore Gulf (Osburn <em>et al</em>. 2003). The most significant rule conserving Kemp's Ridleys in Texas is a seasonal shrimping closure from Corpus Christi Fish   Pass to the Texas-Mexico border (177 linear km) including all of PAIS from   the beach out to 5 nautical miles from December 1 to the Summer Gulf opening   or July 15. Historically, 68% of the   turtle strandings and less than 3% of the total Texas shrimp weight of   landings occur in this area during this timeframe. However, despite TED   regulations and reductions in fishing effort, significant correlations   between sea turtle stranding rates and shrimp trawling intensities in the northwestern   Gulf of Mexico continued to exist through at least 1993 (Caillouet <em>et al</em>.   1996).<br/><br/>Other   gear regulations may also protect Kemp's Ridleys. Several states, including   Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Hampshire and Florida, maintain offshore   areas permanently closed to trawling. The State of Georgia requires the use   of NMFS-approved TEDs in all trawl fisheries operating in state waters. South   Carolina uses a water-temperature trigger to ensure whelk trawling occurs   only when sea turtles are less abundant.&#160;   Many states (South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas)   have prohibited gillnets, but there remain active fisheries in other states   and in Federal waters.&#160; Several   regulations have been implemented to protect sea turtles, including Kemp's Ridleys. Since 2001, gillnet   restrictions have been implemented in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, and in   offshore waters of the Economic Exclusive Zone to reduce sea turtle   interactions.&#160; In 2002, NMFS   prohibited, in certain areas and at certain times in the Chesapeake Bay,   Virginia, pound nets with leaders having mesh greater than or equal to 30.5   cm and leaders with stringers.<br/><br/>The   Marine Pollution Act was enacted under the International Convention for the   Prevention of Pollution from Ships and subsequent regulations by the United   States Coast Guard (USCG) to restrict the discharge of plastics and set the   standards for other solid waste dumping into the marine environment (Shaver   and Plotkin 1998). A large portion of the debris found washed ashore at the   nesting beach, and presumably floating in neonatal/juvenile pelagic habitat,   is garbage dumped from ships and oil platforms. Over 90% of the trash is   composed of inorganic material, mainly plastic (Sarti <em>et al</em>. 1996).&#160; The regulations prohibit the disposal by   all vessels and offshore platforms of all plastics, paper, rags, glass,   metal, bottles, crockery, and similar refuse.<br/><br/>Oil   and gas exploration activities require mitigation and measures to minimize   the impacts to the Kemp's Ridley nesting beaches and marine environment.   Various Federal, state, and local entities have developed spill contingency   plans that are updated annually. These entities formed emergency response   teams to reduce potential impacts from these spills. Oil and gas exploration   and development occur at PAIS. The NPS   strictly regulates these activities through the use of NPS regulations,   in-depth environmental assessments under the National Environmental Policy   Act, consultation with resource agencies, and close coordination with the mineral   owners and developers. The NPS and FWS   work to make sure that the conditions under which approval of this drilling   is granted protect the park's resources, especially the Kemp's Ridley turtle.   Measures have been developed to protect Kemp's Ridleys, and the plans   allowing for the drilling of new wells incorporate these strict   measures. Patrols are conducted at   PAIS to locate and move eggs for protected incubation, thereby limiting   threats from oil and gas activities and natural threats to the eggs and   hatchlings. Beach patrols also involve location and protection of nesting and   live- stranded turtles, although beach visitors sometimes find them before   patrollers arrive. Oil and gas development and exploration in other areas on   the Texas coast where Kemp's Ridleys have been documented nesting are   regulated by various local, state, and Federal regulations.</p>",Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
155088836,7709,Emydoidea blandingii,Endangered,A2cde+4ce,2011,2010-08-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Emydoidea blandingii</em> is evaluated as Endangered                 A2cde+A4ce, given extensive slow declines of most of its populations from habitat loss and direct removal, accidental mortality and increased predation, and its very long generation time of 36–47 years and slow rate of potential recovery. The species was previously listed as LR/nt.","Blanding's Turtle uses a variety of permanent and temporary wetland habitats, with a preference for shallow clear standing water with abundant aquatic vegetation, but can be found in almost any waterbody in their area. The animals are highly mobile and move extensively between wetlands; nesting occurs in open grasslands, often well away from water.                 Animals leave strong scent trails, increasing their vulnerability to raccoon and fox predation. The species feeds mainly on crayfish and other small animal prey, but also scavenges and takes plant material and seeds.<br/><br/>Males reach 28 cm carapace length (CL), females 22 cm CL. Maturity is reached at about 12 years (20 cm CL) in males, and at 14–20 years (16–19 cm CL) in females. Longevity can be at least 77 years in the wild. Blanding's Turtle has been subject of arguably the most detailed population dynamics analysis of any turtle, documenting that animals mature at the age of 14 at the earliest, and generation times were calculated to vary between 36 and 47 years (Congdon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, Ernst and Lovich 2009).<br/><br/>Females produce one or two clutches of 8–15 eggs (range 3–22, substantial geographic variation) in a reproductive year, but only half the females in a population may reproduce in a given year. Incubation takes about 82–96 (range 65–128) days, with substantial geographic variation. Hatchlings measure about 33 mm.<br/><br/> [Reviews available in Congdon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008), and Ernst and Lovich (2009)]","<p>Blanding's Turtles have been reported as being impacted by road mortality and collection for trade. They also at least locally from habitat degradation, fragmentation and destruction, and increased predation of eggs, young and possibly adults from subsidized predators (i.e., unnaturally large populations of predators subsidized by easily available resources near human settlements), but little quantitative data on the severity of these factors appears available. </p>  <p>Road mortality risk increases with progressive expansion and increased density of rural road networks. </p>  <p>Blanding’s Turtle is the second commonest turtle species in bycatch of the commercial trapping of snapping turtles using baited traps, and a ready market exists (Harding, pers comm. Aug 2009).</p>  <p>Given its particular population dynamics, slightly increased rates of loss of juveniles and adults significantly affects a population. </p>","<p>Populations of Blanding's Turtle are often small and localized, with populations of a few dozen or hundred turtles, and densities ranging from 0.02 animals per hectare in Maine to 28/ha in Wisconsin, 55/ha in Missouri, and up to 57/ha in Nebraska. The largest known population, in Nebraska, is estimated at over 130,000 animals, excluding hatchlings and yearlings (Lang 2004). In contrast, Pennsylvania populations may total a few dozen individuals. Populations in Illinois and Ohio are perceived to be in ongoing decline, possibly associated with increased predation by raccoons (D. Mifsud, pers. comm. 2009).</p><p> Some populations appear stable over time, while others were documented as declining (Brodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Smith <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Summaries of these can be found in Congdon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008) and Ernst and Lovich 2009.</p>  <p>Participants at the MidWest USA Turtle RL WS estimated that 30–50% of suitable habitat and the populations they contained have been lost in recent decades, while many remaining populations have reduced in size.</p>",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Emydoidea blandingii</span> inhabits the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States, the upper Mississippi basin, and the Niobrara and Platte River Systems of the Missouri; scattered populations occur in the lower Hudson Valley of New York, in the eastern Massachusetts (SE New Hampshire) southern Maine area, and in Nova Scotia (Iverson 1992, Congdon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).","Blanding's Turtle is not consumed and occurs in the commercial pet trade at relatively low but persistent numbers in the high-end pet trade in recent years, including export to Japan.
