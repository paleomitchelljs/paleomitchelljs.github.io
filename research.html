				<p>My research program is focused around using fossils and phylogenies to understand what shapes macroevolutionary dynamics. For my dissertation, I studied ecomorphology in living and extinct birds. Since then, I have worked on dinosaurs, salamanders, squirrels, swallows and many other groups.</p>
      	<p>I have done fieldwork in Argentina, Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming and North Carolina.</p>
		<p><img src="/graphs/foodweb.png" alt="foodweb", width=400, height=400>One of my major focuses is on how ecosystem structure impacts macroevolutionary dynamics. Fossil ecosystems provide a ripe opportunity to examine how climatic fluctuations, mass extinction events, and new lineage evolution impact community composition. Many ecological models, such as <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12062/full">Bayesian Network food webs</a>, try to predict extinction probabilities from fundamental measures of food web topology. However, without observed extinction data, they cannot be parameterized. Fossil ecosystems may have uncertain topologies, but they provide observable extinction events that can parameterize ecological models. By fitting ecological models to fossil data, we can learn more about ancient ecosystems and more about how ecological models function. It's a win for both ecologists and paleoecologists.</p>
