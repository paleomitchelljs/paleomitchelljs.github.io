				<p>My research program is focused around using fossils and phylogenies to understand what shapes macroevolutionary dynamics. For my dissertation, I studied ecomorphology in living and extinct birds. Since then, I have worked on dinosaurs, salamanders, squirrels, swallows and many other groups.</p>
      	<p>I have done fieldwork in Argentina, Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming and North Carolina.</p>

			One of my major research interests is how ecosystem structure impacts macroevolutionary dynamics. Fossil ecosystems provide a ripe opportunity to examine how climatic fluctuations, mass extinction events, and the evolution of new clades impact community composition. Many ecological models, such as <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12062/full">Bayesian Network food webs</a>, try to predict extinction probabilities from fundamental measures of food web topology. However, without observed extinction data, they cannot be parameterized. Fossil ecosystems may have uncertain topologies, but they provide observable extinction events that can parameterize ecological models. By fitting ecological models to fossil data, we can learn more about ancient ecosystems and more about how ecological models function. It's a win for both ecologists and paleoecologists. The major sources of uncertainty in fossil food webs are: 1) how <a href="#pres">preservation</a> biases our view of what organisms lived in a community, and 2) the <a href="#eco">ecology</a> of the extinct species within the community.</p>

			<a name="pres"></a>Preservation is not uniform among species. Some organisms are larger, or have more fossilizable hard-parts, or live in more preservable environments than others. This means that our view of the composition of an ancient ecosystem is inherently biased. We only know about the most preservable organisms that lived in the environment, and the most preservable organisms are an ecologically non-random subset of all of the species that made up an ancient community. However, the biases in preservation are fundamentally understandable. Traits that influence preservation can be measured, and we can model what sort of species are most likely truly absent from an ancient community (that is, what species would we expect to see based on preservation, but don't).</p>

			<a name="eco"></a>Extinct organisms cannot be tracked and observed to see how they foraged and what foods they ate. Understanding the ecology of extinct species requires building models to predict how ecology and morphology are related in extant taxa, and then applying these models to extinct species with known morphologies to predict their ecologies. But fossil specimens often preserve "extra" information like fossilized gut contents or stable isotope signatures of diet. By testing how well ecomorphological models predict this "extra" information, I have been working on assessing the uncertainty surrounding ecological reconstructions in extinct lineages.</p>
